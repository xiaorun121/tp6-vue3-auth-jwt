To accept the gamer chair is to accept the implication of Dorito dust. To <em>know</em> the gamer chair is to let your pantsless butt sit on it for a long time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I can’t tell you anything new about gaming chairs—they are still gaudy and expensive—but I have been sitting my butt on the <em>Fortnite </em>Battle Bus edition of the Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 Series for a while now, and I can tell you that, honestly, it gets the job done<br></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h77929\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The <em>Fortnite </em>part</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">First we need to address the Battle Bus in the room. I don’t play <em>Fortnite</em>, but when Secretlab asked me if I wanted to review its latest special edition Titan, I thought it could be funny. For whom? I’m not sure.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For me, I guess. It’s just the <em>Fortnite</em> Battle Bus gamer chair. It’s magical. It feels like the <em>Fortnite </em>Battle Bus chair could be the egg MrBeast was born from, emerging as a fully grown adult, smiling with his menacing <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.svg.com/img/gallery/mrbeast-and-gordon-ramsays-collab-has-fans-going-wild/l-intro-1654017060.jpg\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.svg.com/img/gallery/mrbeast-and-gordon-ramsays-collab-has-fans-going-wild/l-intro-1654017060.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mouthful of gamer teeth</a></span>.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s a conversation piece. When people see my <em>Fortnite</em> chair, they ask, “is that a <em>Fortnite</em> chair?” And, you know what, it is. On its front, it has turquoise embroidery that says FORTNITE. This is so everyone can understand that this mostly normal-looking chair is actually a <em>Fortnite</em> chair. Some of the chair’s accessories came in <em>Fortnite</em>-themed boxes, too, but, overall, it’s a normal chair that says FORTNITE on it. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"df91549f087be360fed976167c085633\" data-recommend-id=\"image://df91549f087be360fed976167c085633\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A woman holds a blue Secretlab box.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"df91549f087be360fed976167c085633\" data-recommend-id=\"image://df91549f087be360fed976167c085633\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A woman holds a blue Secretlab box.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I had hoped, though, that the <em>Fortnite</em> Battle Bus chair would look more like a Battle Bus seat so I could finally combine my love of gaming, public transportation, and hot air balloon technology. Alas, the <em>Fortnite</em> chair only displays an embroidered image of the Battle Bus on its back. You have to gaze into its sunset-pink threads to envision yourself floating away on the airborne Battle Bus—your butt will never know such a sensation.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h77930\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Setting up the chair</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <em>Fortnite</em> gamer chair, in a massive cardboard box that I and a few friends could use as a makeshift Noah’s ark, was delivered August 22. That’s three weeks of sitting time for those of you keeping track.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This particular edition of the Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 is available for pre-order directly from the Secretlab site at $624 for small and regular sizes, the latter of which is recommended for people up to 6’2” and under 220 pounds, and $674 for the extra-large size, which is recommended for people up to 6’9” and 395 pounds. This size inclusivity is appreciated and a staple of Secretlab chairs—in a 2017 review of the Titan, big guy and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/mike-fahey-kotaku-eulogy-obituary-senior-reporter-1849501728\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/mike-fahey-kotaku-eulogy-obituary-senior-reporter-1849501728\"><em>Kotaku</em> staffer Mike Fahey</a></span> wrote that the chair was a “fine place to spend hours on your copious end.”<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Immediately after the big box was delivered, my <em>League of Legends</em> boyfriend and I started putting the chair together. Overall, the process was simple and easily explained by the massive, poster-sized instruction sheet that came with it, but the chair is pretty heavy, and you will need a buddy if you are pea-sized and weak like me. The box comes with strips of thin foam to place heavy pieces on and make moving easier, though, which is helpful. All told, setting up the <em>Fortnite</em> chair took about 50 sweaty minutes.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"a20a1adf5d623fd14de4fe799c5b8aa0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a20a1adf5d623fd14de4fe799c5b8aa0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3023\" data-height=\"1701\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A man holds a large Secretlab instruction sheet.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"a20a1adf5d623fd14de4fe799c5b8aa0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://a20a1adf5d623fd14de4fe799c5b8aa0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3023\" data-height=\"1701\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A man holds a large Secretlab instruction sheet.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h77931\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Sitting down in the chair</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I immediately started sitting down in the chair. Who wouldn’t? It’s a chair for <em>Fortnite</em>.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It has all the comfort-focused features of a standard Titan Evo 2022 chair, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://secretlab.co/pages/titan-evo-2022-series\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://secretlab.co/pages/titan-evo-2022-series\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which means</a></span> things like a proprietary <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://blog.secretlab.co/stories/secretlab-neo-hybrid-leatherette-vs-softweave-plus-fabric-which-should-you-choose/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://blog.secretlab.co/stories/secretlab-neo-hybrid-leatherette-vs-softweave-plus-fabric-which-should-you-choose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">synthetic leather</a></span>, seat curved for “ergonomic support,” and adjustable lumbar support. It is a stiff chair, which might take some getting used to if you’re used to seats with more cushioning or flexibility, but its stiffness ultimately makes it feel more supportive than cramped.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The headrest is a magnetic, detachable cushion. I like that you can place it near your head or your neck, as preferred. The magnet that holds it in place starts at the very tip of the chair and ends fairly low, so I can lounge comfortably against the cushion even though I’m technically too short for the regular-sized chair Secretlab sent me.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The doorway to my gaming room was too narrow to get the chunky <em>Fortnite </em>chair in there, so I ended up rotating it between my living room and dining room and adjusting the chair in different ways depending on what I was doing. Sitting in the chair for an extended period of time doing different things, like typing on my laptop, playing a console game, or eating at the table, never hurt my back or felt awkward.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">One impressive adjustment is how the chair allows you to go from sitting stick-straight to leaning almost completely flat on your back. During a Mets game viewing, my non-gamer friend Will sat in the gaming chair and reclined all the way back. It was the longest anyone had sat in the chair with the recline so extreme, and there were a few moments when I thought he would fall down and become concussed by the <em>Fortnite</em> chair. But “I feel safe,” he told me when I expressed concern. “I trust the chair.”<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"d406f98b9e6ecd3cf3b5578cfe1b346d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d406f98b9e6ecd3cf3b5578cfe1b346d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Secretlab\'s Fortnite chair is positioned straight ahead.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"d406f98b9e6ecd3cf3b5578cfe1b346d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d406f98b9e6ecd3cf3b5578cfe1b346d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Secretlab\'s Fortnite chair is positioned straight ahead.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h77932\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Complaining about the chair</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The chair is supportive, kind, and loves <em>Fortnite</em>. These are qualities you really must admire. But, during the chair’s assembly, I was disappointed to remove some untouched pieces from their packages and find they already had dings on them. This was a review product, but if I had paid its hefty full price, I’d be frustrated by the pieces not being immaculate upon arrival. Likewise, though this chair is happy to provide you with battle royale-themed succor, I’m a nerd about fashion and the stitching on this chair, to me, looks fast and loose. Long, loose stitches mean that fabric is held less securely, making a garment or, in this case, a <em>Fortnite</em> chair, more susceptible to tearing or fraying. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"38b391e785af9109e6cdccdee8c4fa36\" data-recommend-id=\"image://38b391e785af9109e6cdccdee8c4fa36\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3024\" data-height=\"1701\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Secretlab armrest displays signs of wear.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"38b391e785af9109e6cdccdee8c4fa36\" data-recommend-id=\"image://38b391e785af9109e6cdccdee8c4fa36\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3024\" data-height=\"1701\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Secretlab armrest displays signs of wear.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This isn’t a complaint as much as it is a heads up—I was way too small for the standard chair at 5’4 and 120 pounds. I still enjoyed sitting in it, but sometimes I felt like a baby pretending to be the president, and often sat on it cross-legged or with both knees up. The armrests and chair height are not nearly as customizable as the back of the chair. They budge more than they transform. So if a chair isn’t in your suggested height and weight class, you might struggle in finding a perfect calibration, which is something you’re presumably looking for in dropping over 500 dollars on a chair.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This chair and its packaging was also not nearly as aggressively <em>Fortnite</em>-themed as I kind of wanted it to be, so if you’re a <em>Fortnite</em> superfan only interested in the chair for its collectibility, that is something to note, too. Secretlab also released three <em>Fortnite</em>-edition memory foam <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://secretlab.co/products/secretlab-fortnite-edition-lumbar-pillow\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://secretlab.co/products/secretlab-fortnite-edition-lumbar-pillow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“lumbar pillows”</a></span> fashioned after Peely, Llama, and Cuddle Team Leader, but you have to pre-order these separately for $59 each, and they currently ship two weeks later than the chair.

Be aware that making the chair a good match will depend on whether or not you get a size that reflects your needs, that the chair’s quality might not be exactly what you want for the price, and that its <em>Fortnite</em> theme is literally skin-deep. It’s a chair first, <em>Fortnite</em> experience second.

From the 80’s to early 2010’s, Sam (mother died in a car accident, Harvard math dropout, good in front of crowds), Sadie (doesn’t believe in marriage, MIT game design wunderkind, prone to working crunch hours), and, for a time, Marx (rich, handsome, Harvard-roommate-turned-game-producer) come together because of games. To them, playtime is personal, political, and the result of their dedicated, exacting work. Games require blood sacrifice—not sleeping enough, fighting too much—but in them, you can claim your little piece of immortality.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sam, whose leg was shattered in 27 places in the devastating car crash that killed his mother, turns to games to inhabit a body more steady than his own. Sadie, who got into games while her sister battled childhood cancer, likes losing herself in a better, safer world. And Marx just thinks games are fun.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But Zevin maps their disparate reasons for playing to their temperaments. At Unfair Games, the company conceived in their college apartment, Sam is fond of creating in-game facsimiles of himself, Sadie rages over the real world’s blindness to women developers, and Marx, again, likes having fun.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">To these characters, video games are a necessity indistinguishable from all of life’s other worthy pursuits, on par with or better than making lots of money and having sex. Zevin presents their devotion to the craft with gentle authority. By the end of my reading, some of which I spent a bit weepily, thinking about the friendships and games in my life, I felt that my belief in video games had been restored. I didn’t even know it needed restoration. But Zevin suggests that games are like relationships, in that way. They are things that could tap you on the shoulder when you’re busy being brooding and occupied, reminding you that everything and everyone  occasionally requires some TLC.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-novel-Gabrielle-Zevin/dp/0593321200/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/gabrielle-zevin-video-game-design-fiction-novel-review-1849442689&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"0593321200\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\"><em>Tomorrow</em></a></span>’s third-person omniscient narrator, whose storytelling flits across decades (“[Sadie] would never be much of a drinker,” the narrator informs us while Sadie is still in college), and in one particularly meta section, dives into a game, pronounces aphorisms about the overlap of play, life, and love like a Greek oracle in reverie.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 jXybyg align--left js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"62ad566bc94c5223a6fbef3094068837\" data-recommend-id=\"image://62ad566bc94c5223a6fbef3094068837\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1875\" data-height=\"2850\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The cover of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:1875px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"62ad566bc94c5223a6fbef3094068837\" data-recommend-id=\"image://62ad566bc94c5223a6fbef3094068837\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1875\" data-height=\"2850\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The cover of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“To play requires trust and love,” “A name is destiny, if you think it is,” “the human brain is every bit as closed a system as a Mac,” it predicts with delicious conviction. The title <em>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</em> on its own is a sort of bold divination, coming from a soliloquy in Marx’s beloved <em>Macbeth</em>. In the address, Macbeth dismisses life as “a tale / Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, / Signifying nothing.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“What is a game?” Marx asks Sam and Sadie. “It’s[...]the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win.”<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Though Marx and Sadie’s friendship eventually turns romantic, Sam and Sadie, the older, arguably, more important relationship (“There were so many people who could be your lover,” the narrator says, “but[...]there were relatively few people who could move you creatively”) never does. It, instead, alights and broils for three decades. They come together, pull apart, come together, pull apart. It’s not romantic, Sam and Sadie themselves say often, but it is devotion. Like trying to reach a high score or believing in a God. “He has made everything beautiful in its time,” says Ecclesiastes 3:11. “He has also set eternity in the human heart.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite its everlasting chastity, Sam and Sadie’s relationship reminded me of the time-spanning romances in the movies <em>The Way We Were </em>and <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>…, both of which, like <em>Tomorrow</em>, are more interested in the process of love than the kissing. Friendship is a form of art, a prayer. But, memorably, in <em>The Way We Were</em>, Barbra Streisand’s character pleads with Robert Redford, who is on the brink of leaving her and becoming nothing more than a friend.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Couldn’t we both win?” she asks him sincerely.<br></p>\n<aside class=\"sc-o6p93a-0 gJydMU\"><span class=\"sc-196v4ms-0 bpQblS\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span><span class=\"sc-a3cloy-0 bzNnZL\">“Despite any diminishing returns, humans don’t give up, we wait for something good to float down into our palms.”</span><span class=\"sc-196v4ms-0 bpQblS\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">No, we couldn’t. In Sadie’s childhood favorite game, <em>The Oregon Trail</em>, hunting more bison than you can eat allows their meat to spoil. For you to live in sensual excess, the bison must lose—Sadie feels bad about this. Sam, Sadie, and Marx all love each other from their heads to their toes, but when Sadie and Marx fall <em>in love</em> and buy a house, Sam feels that he’s some platonic love loser. Everyone wants to win. Everyone wants more. But Zevin finds comfort in everyday losses—in business, love, and death. Like Marx (and Shakespeare) says, despite any diminishing returns, humans don’t give up, we wait for something good to float down into our palms.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Zevin spends much of the novel ruminating on this contradiction. In games and in getting older, interpersonal drama and death become expected. Cheap. Still, you hold tight to the moments that lit you up, a week ago, ten years ago. Another game designer, at one point, tells Sam that she loves the way Sadie “does blood.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Maybe it’s my imagination,” she says, “but I feel like she has people bleeding slightly different colors[...]. It’s a small thing, [...]but I’m obsessed with it.”<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Likewise, Sadie’s anger with Sam always softens when she recognizes him as the child she met in her sister’s children’s hospital decades ago, or as the boy she ran into again at college, who lied about being able to see the hidden image in the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://newyork.museumofillusions.us/magic-eye-can-you-see-it/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://newyork.museumofillusions.us/magic-eye-can-you-see-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Magic Eye posters</a></span> that beguiled the 90s.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“<em>This is what time travel is,</em>” Sam thinks to himself during that college run-in. “It’s looking at a person, and seeing them in the present and the past, concurrently.”<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The only thing that gifts you immortality, apart from video games, <em>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</em> suggests, is hope.

Even nasty <em>Kotaku</em> commenters, who Zevin amusingly notes responded to Sam saying in an interview that “there is no more intimate act than play, even sex” with deciding “there must be something seriously wrong with Sam,” cannot tamper the internal motor that makes us want to live, again, again. This book, with its respect for craft—the craft of love and games, or loving games—will remind you of how abundant one life is, how lucky we are to keep each other in our memories forever. </p>\n<aside class=\"sc-1c7snby-0 gGJizi\"></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> <br></p>', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', 'Work, Life, And Sex All Revolve Around Video Games In This Devastating Fiction Book', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/44a7ced172b422ed02862bece7e30045.jpg', 'etc', 'https://kotaku.com/gabrielle-zevin-video-game-design-fiction-novel-review-1849442689', 'We will never find the Fountain of Youth people fantasized about centuries ago, ...', NULL);

If you ever do receive such a heads-up, you’d be wise to heed it. I learned so while playing <em>Renaissance Faire</em>, a massively multiplayer real-world role-playing game that is only nominally about the Renaissance.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Rewind to 2019: Some friends and I were booting up <em>Renaissance Faire</em> for the first time (read: sitting on a bus, apocalyptically hungover, at 10:15 a.m. on a Saturday), discussing whether it’d be a blast or a bust. That’s when we met the most magical man I’ve ever seen in my life. A guy in a sleeveless tunic and leather bycocket, holding a Bud Light glistening with cool condensation in one hand. He turned to face us, and started explaining how <em>Renaissance Faire</em> can shift your perspective so subtly you don’t even register the change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“You’re hangin’ out, and you’re pounding mead, and your brain just, like, flips,” he said, rotating his empty hand in a motion that I think suggested a human brain doing a cartwheel. “You don’t really realize it. But your brain just flips, man.”</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">He was absolutely correct. I just didn’t know it at the time.</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I recently gave <em>Renaissance Faire</em>, affectionately called <em>RenFaire</em> by diehard fans, another spin.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>RenFaire</em> draws heavily from an older game called <em>Renaissance, But Also Many Other Eras From Human History For Some Reason</em>. Blessedly, the more modern versions of <em>Renaissance Faire</em> have completely done away with most of what made <em>Renaissance, But Also Many Other Eras...</em> such a drag—the wars, the famine, the illness, the public executions, the chamber pots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Since the latter half of the 20th century, <em>Renaissance Faire</em> has come out on an annual release schedule, though it was inadvisable to play last year due to an unprecedented number of bugs. Each subsequent version doesn’t iterate much on form. To you, that might sound like creative inertia for the express purpose of easy profit. To me, it suggests that <em>Renaissance Faire</em> has achieved true mastery of form: It’s confident in what it is, knows exactly what it wants to deliver, and then delivers on it reliably.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Renaissance Faire\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"renaissance-faire\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Renaissance Faire</em> sets you and thousands of other people in a makeshift village designed to look like a town (sorry, towne) from an indeterminate period of history. Your goal, ostensibly, is to steadfastly pretend like you live in that indeterminate period of history, but it’s most fun if you simply go with the flow. You can play various mini-games, you can hand over money to buy <em>stuff</em>, you can watch in-game concerts and performances. About two-thirds of attendees are dressed in their snazziest costumes and other optional cosmetic options. The rest are just there, in blue denim and pima cotton T-shirts, for shits and giggles (and turkey legs). They’ll come back next year in full costume.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, and other live-service games, <em>Renaissance Faire</em> features a hodgepodge of characters from across the spectrum of popular fiction. For instance, at the knife-throwing mini-game (which rules), you can see a cavalcade of <em>Genshin Impact</em> heroes. Over at the tests of strength (which also rule), you might see Link or Zelda smash a hammer into a metal thing that sends another metal thing up a third metal thing whereupon it then goes <em>claaaang</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s also a place where you can see one member of a fictional globe-spanning conspiracy assassinate another member of a <em>different</em> fictional globe-spanning conspiracy:</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"606fc2fdbc2136bb6959ccf084b7062c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://606fc2fdbc2136bb6959ccf084b7062c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A guy dressed as assassin\'s creed assassin pretends to assassinate a guy dressed as Jesus at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"606fc2fdbc2136bb6959ccf084b7062c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://606fc2fdbc2136bb6959ccf084b7062c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A guy dressed as assassin\'s creed assassin pretends to assassinate a guy dressed as Jesus at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Eat your heart out, <em>Super Smash Bros</em>.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Many of these characters coalesce in <em>Renaissance Faire</em>’s central hub, which is structured like a village green from an olde-timey town, surrounded by shops (sorry, shoppes) and restaurants. At any vendor, you can fork over in-game currency for a class of restorational items known as “food.” (This currency looks a whole lot like, and converts to the same exact amount as, USD. No place accepts what NPCs refer to as Lady Visa, but there are various magical machines that allow you to use said Lady to source currency, if you’ve the patience for queues (sorry, queueses).) The developers clearly went to lengths to include cuisine that’s meant to evoke the era—y’know, stuff like chicken fingers, hot dogs, falafel, fried calamari, beef gyro, French fries, bloomin’ onions, nachos, and, of course, turkey legs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In nearly all cases, those items cost an arm and a (turkey) leg. The lone reasonably affordable item on the menu is something called a BBQ sundae, which looks like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"e07666161e3be59fd7bbdf9525b62c64\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e07666161e3be59fd7bbdf9525b62c64\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Two people stare at a bbq sundae at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e07666161e3be59fd7bbdf9525b62c64\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e07666161e3be59fd7bbdf9525b62c64\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Two people stare at a bbq sundae at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Honestly? Delicious. Instant 100/100 HP.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">On the fringe of the green, and sprinkled throughout <em>Renaissance Faire</em>’s densely packed world, you’ll find various pubs. Many of these sport names that are totally innocuous on paper but could easily be referred to incorrectly “by mistake” for laughs (to wit: the Cock and Bull, or the Puss’n’Boots). Despite <em>Renaissance Faire</em> being rated E for Everyone, you’ll of course come across no shortage of players who mess those names up in a decidedly T-for-Teen-rated manner. These pubs sell era-appropriate beverages like mead, wine, and cider. You can also imbibe the so-called Lady Sprite. Water costs an egregious five bucks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Yes, that’s one catch of <em>Renaissance Faire</em>: It’s utterly rife with microtransactions, few of which seem set at a fair price point. In fact, you could make a reasonable case that the microtransactions are the point.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Pretty much anywhere you go in <em>Renaissance Faire</em>, you’ll see something to buy. Along roads called Tinker’s Trail and Spende Penny Lane, you can buy rings, charms, bracelets, necklaces, and other gem-adorned accessories. By Lakeside Market, you can buy wool cloaks and leather boots and musical instruments that would fit right in at your local Guitar Center.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You needn’t look hard to find tapestries of housepets or chalices shaped like dragons. At the weapons shop, as with the vast cast of characters, you’ll see wares commonly associated with popular characters from video games: an energy sword from <em>Halo</em>, a buster sword from <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, Mjolnir from <em>Marvel’s Avengers</em>.</p>\n<aside class=\"slideshow-inset js_slideshow align--bleed\"></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite the self-evident ode to capitalism, <em>Renaissance Faire</em>’s vendors aren’t the slightest bit pushy. It’s the fellow players you have to watch out for. As our game was winding down, one of my party members picked up a drinking horn that would make Eivor proud: carved from bone, lacquered, a foot-and-a-half long, sheathed in a burnished leather harness. The thing could probably hold an entire pint—an entire <em>British</em> pint, at that! I, clearly afflicted by the “peer pressure” status effect, didn’t want to spend $65 on a microtransaction, but also didn’t want to walk away empty-handed. So I settled for a smaller horn. $45.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I later learned it could hold just one-third of one bottle of beer.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Also, it was cracked.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">These cosmetic items are all optional and don’t offer any notable gameplay benefits for <em>Renaissance Faire</em>, so if you’re not a sucker like me, you can get by just fine without them. But considering you can’t go elsewhere to source the necessary healing items (like water, which, again: five freakin’ bucks!), the entire microtransaction system feels exploitative by design, to put it charitably.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are also inconsistencies in dialogue among NPCs. For every bartender who asks to see your “drinking parchments,” you’ll meet another who says, bluntly and with modern cadence, “ID?” Whenever you leave a tip, as you should if you’re role-playing a Paragon hero, the bartender clashes a cymbal and rallies the crowd for hoots and hollers. Some NPCs get into it. Others merely offer polite thanks. Personally, I far prefer the latter, as the former can get cloying—both for the patron and, assuredly, the bartender, who’d have to do so dozens if not thousands of times over the span of the game. It’s an unmistakable sign the developers didn’t scrutinize the script as well as they could have, and perhaps didn’t fully consider what they’re asking of their NPCs (who I desperately hope are paid a fair wage).</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9bb345257cd952441f66ec5d83eaf4bb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9bb345257cd952441f66ec5d83eaf4bb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A woman holds a piece of chicken in front of a cat while both are on stage at a Renaissance Faire\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9bb345257cd952441f66ec5d83eaf4bb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9bb345257cd952441f66ec5d83eaf4bb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A woman holds a piece of chicken in front of a cat while both are on stage at a Renaissance Faire\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Other NPCs are always on their game in the various shows you can see. <em>Renaissance Faire</em> is played in real-time, dictated by a complex schedule divided into 15-minute blocks (10:00 a.m. to 6:45 p.m.) spread out over 19 levels. At Queen’s Grove, you can catch historical lectures and performances of Shakespeare. Pagon Wagon Stage hosts comedy shows throughout the day. The Fortune Stage, meanwhile, is home to four daily showings of a variety event called Cirque de Sewer, which stars three cat NPCs performing stunts as directed by a human NPC. (Surely this won’t surprise you, but the cat characters barely comply with instruction. It’s hilarious.) Elsewhere, you can catch demonstrations of glass-blowing, falconry, and acrobatics.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s impossible to see everything; playing <em>Renaissance Faire</em> means making strategic assessments about where you should be and when you should be there (and rallying your party to follow). If you’re a micromanager who loves games like <em>Cities: Skylines</em>, <em>Surviving Mars</em>, or <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/how-to-build-an-unstoppable-party-in-bravely-default-2-1846363373\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/how-to-build-an-unstoppable-party-in-bravely-default-2-1846363373\">th<!-- -->e job-designation subsystem in <em>Bravely Default 2</em></a></span>, you’ll feel a similar thrill from <em>RenFaire</em>.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The crown jewel, at least per crowd size, is the Roselawn Tournament Field level, where you can see the Joust of Skill, the Royal Joust, and the Joust to the Death (PG-13). I’ll let you in on something: It is not, in fact, to the death. Actually, in none of these events do any riders even fall off their horses! Whichever rider taps the other rider with a big stick first wins. <em>Game of Thrones: The Game (of Thrones)</em> this is not. The developers of <em>RenFaire</em> clearly sanitized any wisp of violence from their game, presumably to ensure prime shelf placement in Ye Walmarte.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But that’s such a minor note, as you do not play <em>Renaissance Faire</em> for the violence. (Please, please do not play <em>Renaissance Faire</em> for the violence.) You play for the camaraderie, for the turkey legs, for the brief but all-consuming and ever-lasting sense of escapism—a whirlwind tourist’s trip to a place, untethered from time and responsibility, where you can do nothing but go with the flow. How rare. How beautiful.</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Two years ago, the idea to play <em>RenFaire ‘19</em> started as an inside joke among some friends and me. We showed up in jeans and plain shirts. Strolling down Storybrook Lane, we reflected on Mr. Brain Flip’s eloquent bus soliloquy and, I’ll confess, teased him a bit.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">By the middle of the afternoon, as my party and I were sitting in a circle with a dozen people dressed as pirates, all of us shouting along to a rendition of “<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGyPuey-1Jw\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGyPuey-1Jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drunken Sailor</a></span>,” it hit me: Our brains were well and truly flipped. And they weren’t gonna un-flip. (Pleading the Fifth on how much blackberry mead we’d consumed at that point—the drunken effects are surprisingly realistic.) It’s not so often you get to experience a paradigmatic intellectual shift over the course of an afternoon. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That experience colored my and my party’s approach to <em>RenFaire ‘21</em>, namely to take its intoxicating effects seriously. This time, we came prepared. This time, we decked out our characters in our Halloween Sunday best. This time, we made sure to bring extra currency. This time, we modded in several flasks of high-proof booze because those mead vendors are so damn expensive and also have excruciatingly long lines.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"7ce22ce0087bdcb0d9cfe81ad0553f51\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7ce22ce0087bdcb0d9cfe81ad0553f51\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Two knights riding horses at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"7ce22ce0087bdcb0d9cfe81ad0553f51\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7ce22ce0087bdcb0d9cfe81ad0553f51\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Two knights riding horses at a Renaissance Faire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In this, <em>RenFaire</em> reminds me somewhat of <em>Destiny 2</em>.

I’m genuinely looking forward to playing every annual release, so long as circumstances allow for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But I’d be remiss not to mention the one thing players widely cite as a glaring imperfection, a flaw that conversely pulls double duty as perhaps my favorite feature: Playing <em>Renaissance Faire</em> madeth thine author of doth post writeth all of his texts like so.

The opening battle between the men who would become Sub-Zero and Scorpion is one of my favorite cinema moments of the year. The remaining 98 minutes? Not so much. The fights are outstanding, the acting is okay, and the story is complete garbage.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">First off, if you’re looking for a brutal spectacle, <em>Mortal Kombat</em> delivers. If you’re in this to see mostly familiar characters get hit so hard that your teeth rattle, you’re good. If you want to see modern fatalities, the gruesome gory ones, depicted in a somewhat passable facsimile of real life, that’s in there too. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Director Simon McQuoid did an excellent job making attractive people look like they are killing each other, and the attractive people are very good at being attractive. Many of them aren’t too shabby at acting either. Josh Lawson is a treat as cutthroat mercenary Kano, delivering some truly laugh-out-loud moments. Joe Taslim as Bi-Han / Sub-Zero and Hiroyuki Sanada as Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion are so good in the opening moments they had me fooled into thinking the movie might be much better than I hoped. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> <small><em>There’s a lot of good stuff in the first seven minutes of the movie. </em></small></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Following that fateful fight the movie jumps to modern times, where things pretty quickly go wrong. We’re introduced to Cole, played by Lewis Tan, a down-on-his luck MMA fighter and family man who finds himself thrust into an ancient tournament between Earthrealm and Outworld because he carries a mystical dragon birthmark passed down by his ancestor, Scorpion. Cole is completely unaware of the meaning of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> logo on his body until Jax, played by the delightful Mehcad Brooks (Jimmy Olsen from CW’s <em>Supergirl</em>), shows up to fill him in. Cole’s the type of guy who never thought to Google “dragon head in circle birthmark.” If he was, he would have known that this special mark only appears on warriors tasked with defending Earthrealm in regular <em>Mortal Kombat</em> tournaments.<br></p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"wtzfofeyjcgjm7fo0bs1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wtzfofeyjcgjm7fo0bs1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"660\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"wtzfofeyjcgjm7fo0bs1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wtzfofeyjcgjm7fo0bs1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"660\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That’s kind of stupid, right? It gets even more stupid. Apparently if someone with the mark is killed, the mark then transfers to their killer. That’s how the brutish and mostly-inept Kano winds up in the tournament, while a more capable character like Sonya Blade does not. Hmm.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Unfortunately for the entire Earthrealm crew—that is Cole, Kano, Liu Kang, Raiden, Jax, and Kung Lao—villainous Outworld boss Shang Tsung has come up with an evil plan. Instead of Outworld merely defeating Earthrealm in the Mortal Kombat tournament, as it’s done several times over the centuries, he decides to send out his minions to murder Earthrealm’s heroes beforehand. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That’s right. There is no tournament in this <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie. Instead, Shang Tsung and pals Sub-Zero, Mileena, Nitara, Kabal, Reiko, and Goro attack Earth’s champions and their families directly. It took Shang Tsung hundreds of years to come up with this plan. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s kind of brilliant, really. Earthrealm’s forces are vulnerable. One fighter has his arms ripped off by Sub-Zero in the trailer. Two others are still in the middle of training, trying to awaken their latent super powers. By the way, that’s how <em>Mortal Kombat</em> fighters get their special attacks in this world: T<!-- -->hey awaken with use. Yes, even the mechanical ones. It’s so dumb. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"iyjvvtpapk3irtdurugq\" data-recommend-id=\"image://iyjvvtpapk3irtdurugq\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"660\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"iyjvvtpapk3irtdurugq\" data-recommend-id=\"image://iyjvvtpapk3irtdurugq\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"660\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Maybe dumb is what a <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie needs to be. Perhaps the best possible outcome is a film with really cool fighting, a few giggles, and a painfully bad plot. It’s really good at all of those things. The idea of a regular tournament held to determine if one realm can invade the other is pretty ridiculous.

It takes me back to the ‘80s, when fans didn’t know any better and were happy with what we had.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Released in 1983 in both standup and cockpit configurations, Atari’s<em> Star Wars</em> game was a unique presence in ‘80s arcades, shopping centers, and movie theater lobbies. The cabinet drew the eye, with dueling X-wings and TIE Fighters framingthe iconic logo. Voice samples from actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Alec Guinness, and James Earl Jones lured players in, along with the growls of Chewbacca and the beeps of R2-D2. </p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 dlwqzz align--right js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"csagjmwiixcxuaigpsmb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://csagjmwiixcxuaigpsmb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"1551\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:1200px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"csagjmwiixcxuaigpsmb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://csagjmwiixcxuaigpsmb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"1551\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The most unique feature of the cabinet, the feature that captured my imagination and many of my parents’ quarters, was the flight yoke. In lieu of a basic joystick, the <em>Star Wars</em> arcade game featured real spaceship controls, or at least what 11-year-old me imagined were real spaceship controls. The two-handed flight yoke added an amazing tactile feel to the game, helping the vector graphics representing the TIE Fighters and Death Star come to life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The flight yoke is the key to the new Star Wars arcade machine’s unique charm. The folks at Arcade1Up have recreated it perfectly in three-quarter scale. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"k3vqdhih1cji2zj4y8jw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://k3vqdhih1cji2zj4y8jw\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"1500\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"k3vqdhih1cji2zj4y8jw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://k3vqdhih1cji2zj4y8jw\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"1500\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">My hands are much larger than they were in the ‘80s, but the Arcade1Up <em>Star Wars</em> flight yoke feels just like the real thing did back in the day, even at three-quarter scale. It’s still an outstanding way to control a spaceship. It’s oddly intuitive as well. My eight-year-olds took to it like old pros once they figured out that the 17-inch LCD screen was not touch-sensitive. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"s3ky31egpey6mfbuvnge\" data-recommend-id=\"image://s3ky31egpey6mfbuvnge\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1440\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"s3ky31egpey6mfbuvnge\" data-recommend-id=\"image://s3ky31egpey6mfbuvnge\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1440\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Arcade1Up <em>Star Wars</em> home arcade machine emulates three classic Atari games. There’s the original <em>Star Wars</em>, in which players do battle against colorful TIE Fighters while attacking the Death Star. 1985’s <em>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</em> was a conversion for the cabinet that recreates the Battle of Hoth, with Luke piloting a snowspeeder fighting walkers and Han Solo in the Falcon navigating an asteroid field.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The third game, <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, came out in 1984. Instead of a vector-based display, it featured the more standard CRT-based raster graphics and was presented in an isometric overhead view. Using the same flight yoke as the other two games, players piloted the Millennium Falcon, speeder bikes, and an AT-ST. I prefer the vector games, but all three play quite well on the Arcade1Up cabinet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is my second Arcade1Up machine. I also own the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://arcade1up.com/products/final-fight\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://arcade1up.com/products/final-fight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more traditional <em>Final Fight</em> cabinet</a></span>. It’s cool, but nowhere near as cool as the <em>Star Wars</em> model. It’s also nowhere near as expensive as the <em>Star Wars</em> model, which runs $500 to the <em>Final Fight</em> cabinet’s $200. The extra price is a combination of licensing, the unique controller hardware, and the included riser, which makes the machine around five feet tall—the perfect height for me in my wheelchair. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite the unique hardware, assembly of the unit only takes around an hour. As I am paralyzed from the chest down, my wife put it together for me. Everything works, nothing has fallen off, and nothing has exploded.

It was fun. I didn’t know what I doing and over time I learned what RAM was and what a motherboard is. Then I stopped doing that, bought some consoles and only bought pre-made PCs at Walma<!-- -->rt that I would use mainly for writing. But last year I bought an actual gaming PC and have since been improving it. Recently, I finally replaced the video card and it was an ordeal.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Back when I was younger, all the PC parts I had access to were cheap and old. All the parts were covered in dust or were part of the computers that nobody wanted. Breaking anything didn’t matter. Because it was all garbage and leftovers anyways. But when I decided to install a brand new video card into my main and only computer, which I use for work too, things became a lot more stressful. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I did all the research and found the video card I wanted. And it was on sale on Black Friday. So I went down to the store with some family and picked it up, then brought it home and began the process of installing this damn thing. </p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Installing A Video Card\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"installing-a-video-card\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When I was a kid, getting into PCs was tricky. Most of the computers I was working on were old plastic and metal boxes. Nothing just opened easily. Sometimes I would break cases trying to get to the guts of an old Compaq. But today, PCs are so easy to open. My case has three hand-tightened screws to take off and that’s it. After doing that I was face-to-face with my PC’s innards. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The first thing I needed to do was remove the video card. This involved removing some screws on the outside of the PC case. The new video card didn’t come with any instructions or tips, so as I worked on the PC my girlfriend looked up instructions online. The first site she found wasn’t very helpful.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“It just says, remove the old card carefully and replace it with the new card, making sure to plug all the cables in before closing the case.” Very helpful. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The thing is, and I knew this as I nervously began poking at my old video card, there isn’t much to installing a new video card. It is, at least on paper, very easy. But I have big hands and I’m a bit clumsy, so as I started to pull out the old video card I couldn’t really SEE what I was doing. Though I did see something: The motherboard started to flex as I pulled on the card. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Shit!” I stopped and paced around a little bit. I could feel my heartbeat and even though it was nearly 2 AM and I had been shopping all night, I wasn’t tired anymore. The last thing I needed was to break my motherboard. I still needed a PC to work on. Plus I didn’t want to buy and install a new motherboard.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"amtr9x2yzg76tjjblzt4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://amtr9x2yzg76tjjblzt4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1023\" data-height=\"576\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"amtr9x2yzg76tjjblzt4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://amtr9x2yzg76tjjblzt4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1023\" data-height=\"576\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The last time I installed a video card was way back in the early 2000s. I wanted to play <em>Battlefield 1942 </em>and <em>Alien Versus Predator 2. </em>But they wouldn’t work on my computer. I called the support line listed on the back of the box of AVP 2 and eventually was told I needed a better video card. After convincing my parents to buy one for me, I got home and installed it. The games worked and I played them for years. I have no idea how I did that. I didn’t even really understand what a graphics card was and yet I was able to install it and start playing. Younger Zack was, it seems, smarter than I realized and braver. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So after pacing for a few minutes that memory of young Zack installing a video card entered my head. I can do this. So I got back in there and start pulling again, but this time I also pushed forward on the card a bit and then BAM! The card was out. Putting the new card in was less scary and after a few minutes of cheering and my GF and I laughing at how nervous I was, I slid the PC back to my desk, turned it on and... nothing. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The monitor said no signal. I waited. Then I turned off the PC and tried again. Nothing. The computer was making noises, the fans on the card were spinning and the computer was clearly doing something, but no picture. Great, I broke my computer. And then, as if the universe decided to finally give me a break, the monitor popped on and the computer boot screen was there. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But those few minutes, where I thought I had broken my entire PC or ruined a new video card, were terrifying. I don’t need to play <em>Alien Isolation</em> or <em>Silent Hill. </em>Next time I want to feel scared I’ll install a video card.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', 'Installing A Video Card: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/bubkyxhabrtazyy9q1vp.jpg', 'etc', 'https://kotaku.com/installing-a-video-card-the-kotaku-review-1840243131', 'Long ago, when I was much younger and had more free time, I would pull apart old...', NULL);

It also is a terrible thing to come home to in the middle of the night.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Earlier this week I attended a wonderful birthday party with friends.

After hours of fun and enjoyment, my girlfriend and I headed home. We arrived, turned on the lights, said hello to the cats and began to relax. That was until suddenly I heard my girlfriend shout my name from the living room. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Zaaaaccccckkkkk? What’s this? Is this.....a SNAKE?!” </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Her reaction was a mixture of fear, anger, shock and a bit of confusion. All fair reactions to have when you find a snake in your house. She had walked over to the sliding glass door and discovered a coiled up black snake, about a foot and an inch long. It was resting on a small brown rug. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I walked over, assuming it wasn’t a snake. Maybe it was too dark and she was confused? Maybe it was a piece of string that had been piled up by the cats? But when I rounded the corner and found her crouched over a black pile on the rug I almost immediately saw what it was. It was, in fact, a snake. </p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Coming Home To A Snake In Your House\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"coming-home-to-a-snake-in-your-house\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A lot of things shot through my head at that moment. Too many to list here. But two key things stayed in my mind: What kind of snake is this and how do I get rid of it? I grew up in Florida. I’ve handled snakes before, even though I really shouldn’t have. Look, I watched a lot of <em>The Crocodile Hunter</em> and <em>Jeff Corwin Experience </em>on Animal Planet. I also lived in a state that is basically a tropical jungle on top of a swamp. So I spent time outside catching things a kid shouldn’t catch. As a result, I was able to identify the snake as a Garter Snake, which is non-venomous. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Here’s the thing though. Looking at images of garter snakes now, after the event, I feel very confident that I identified it correctly. But at the moment, with a snake in your home and cats coming over to investigate, I was far less confident. So as my girlfriend held the cats back, I grabbed a small bowl and gently, but quickly, covered the snake. Then I slid the entire brown rug outside and as I did this the bowl shifted and out popped the head of a snake. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">My hand, which was holding the bowl down, was now a few inches from a small snakehead which was looking at me. I calmy, but rather quickly, lifted my hand and in one motion spun the rug onto the porch and flipped the plastic bowl off the snake.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"eusekp0bfk8sww8qgavt\" data-recommend-id=\"image://eusekp0bfk8sww8qgavt\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1560\" data-height=\"758\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"eusekp0bfk8sww8qgavt\" data-recommend-id=\"image://eusekp0bfk8sww8qgavt\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1560\" data-height=\"758\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After our snake encounter, we plugged up a small gap in the sliding glass door, which seems to be the only way it could have gotten inside. The fear of another snake coming in lingered for the rest of the night. I’m not worried about another Garter Snake sneaking in. I’m worried about a dangerous snake getting in through the same method. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m also sorry that during this ordeal I never snapped a photo of the snake. While I was dealing with this snake, the last thing I thought about was documenting it with a camera. This is more evidence that found footage films are bullshit. Seriously, I only ran into a small snake and didn’t film it. Why would someone fighting an evil bigfoot or whatever film it for hours and hours?<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After all of this, as it slithered away into bushes that I will now fear a bit for the next few months, I felt proud that I didn’t just kill it. Snakes are amazing creatures, important parts of our local ecosystems and deserve respect. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But it absolutely sucks when they decide to slither into your house in the middle of the night.

The movie, which is a sequel to Legendary Pictures’ 2014 <em>Godzilla</em>, feels like a natural evolution of the previous film. In some ways, it’s a better movie—rather, a better <em>Godzilla</em> movie. In other ways, it’s not.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Gareth Edward’s <em>Godzilla</em> was proof that Hollywood no longer was confusing kaiju with dinosaurs <em>à la</em> Roland Emmerich’s 1998 film. This was a movie steeped in the lore of Godzilla, and perhaps fittingly for a reboot, it appeared to be heavily influenced by Toho’s 1954 original. The new Hollywood take was moody, ponderous, and for many fans, short on monster fights. Its sequel sure ain’t.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 jXybyg align--left js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"dutgsvjliqc35t5vgegw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://dutgsvjliqc35t5vgegw\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"355\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:848px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"dutgsvjliqc35t5vgegw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://dutgsvjliqc35t5vgegw\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"355\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Godzilla: King of Monsters</em> centers around a family still mourning a loss suffered several years earlier when Godzilla and the Muto ravaged San Francisco.

The company turns to Mark for help after a group of terrorists that has kidnapped his wife and daughter then makes a move to unleash a truly deadly kaiju foe. Meanwhile, Dr. Serizawa (once again played by Ken Watanabe) urges all to put their faith in Godzilla to handle the situation.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 dlwqzz align--right js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"h1alizqmscabanhahove\" data-recommend-id=\"image://h1alizqmscabanhahove\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"849\" data-height=\"353\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:849px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"h1alizqmscabanhahove\" data-recommend-id=\"image://h1alizqmscabanhahove\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"849\" data-height=\"353\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In the original 1954 film, <em>Godzilla</em> was only on screen for around eight minutes. For audiences of the day, seeing the first kaiju film ever made, that must have been mind-blowing. The 2014 film also only featured around eight minutes of Godzilla, largely cloaked in murky darkness. Modern moviegoers who were eager to see more big-time Hollywood special effects in IMAX were left unsatisfied. But for Edwards, who was looking back to the 1954 original, holding back Godzilla as long as possible apparently made sense. It would’ve been nice to see what was going on, though.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>King of the Monsters</em> isn’t about holding back Godzilla, nor any of the other kaiju. It’s about getting them on screen and having them pummel each other. If you want to see giant monsters beat the tar out of each other, this is the movie for you. <em>King of the Monsters</em> is the most fully realized CG <em>Godzilla</em> film to date, and that’s including the two previous Hollywood movies and Toho’s <em>Godzilla Resurgence</em>, a movie that seems to delight in ditching <em>Godzilla</em> movie conventions in order to make a jab at bureaucratic Japanese politics. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"zhfbeifjiiivjxoquvp3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://zhfbeifjiiivjxoquvp3\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"355\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"zhfbeifjiiivjxoquvp3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://zhfbeifjiiivjxoquvp3\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"355\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Legendary has packed some brutal fight scenes in here, with stuff I’d never seen in a <em>Godzilla</em> movie. Thankfully, the kaiju battles aren’t in the dark as they sadly were in the 2014 film. <em>King of the Monsters</em> is lit with oranges and blues, with a clear understanding that what people want to see is giant monsters throwing down. That they most certainly do. With Michael Dougherty, a diehard <em>Godzilla</em> aficionado since childhood, at the helm, these fights are by a fan for fans. But it’s more than just a slugfest; there are a good number of easter eggs, such as a subtle reference to Mothra’s <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Shobijin\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Shobijin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fairies</a></span>.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 jXybyg align--left js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"jn3kvysc1bmiyc1vliqb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jn3kvysc1bmiyc1vliqb\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"847\" data-height=\"354\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:847px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"jn3kvysc1bmiyc1vliqb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jn3kvysc1bmiyc1vliqb\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"847\" data-height=\"354\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Dougherty seems born to direct<em> Godzilla</em> movies. There is a genuine wonder and awesomeness about the kaiju that was absent in Hollywood’s previous films. He truly cares about these monsters and wants to make them as realistic as possible. I just wish I got that same feeling about the human characters, who feel more like chess pieces to move the plot around. They never feel authentic. Their motivations are either unclear, superficial, or unbelievable. The plot does include the interesting idea of flipping a protagonist into an antagonist, but that’s all it is, an interesting idea. That idea’s execution is inconceivable. In the 2014 film, the characters were, for the most part, believable and empathetic. Their motivations made sense, and even if the movie ran out of gas by the end, those motivations alone were what propelled the story.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 dlwqzz align--right js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"uuprb3p40hmzlhvmqkpa\" data-recommend-id=\"image://uuprb3p40hmzlhvmqkpa\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"353\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:850px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"uuprb3p40hmzlhvmqkpa\" data-recommend-id=\"image://uuprb3p40hmzlhvmqkpa\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"353\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In <em>King of the Monsters</em>, the actions of characters often didn’t make sense. They were propelled by the plot, instead of the other way around. There is one exception to this: Dr. Serizawa. The movie holds him in the same reverence that it does Godzilla and the other kaiju. Considering the character’s place in the <em>Godzilla</em> universe and Dougherty’s reverence for it, that is not surprising. Ken Watanabe, per usual, shines with grace and dignity. In any case, most people seeing this movie will view the non-kaiju scenes as filler between the monster stuff. Fair enough. In that regard, the movie does deliver. This is <em>King of the Monsters</em>, after all, and not King of the Believable Human Characters. <br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When I left the movie, I kept imagining what it would’ve been like if the human drama from the previous film had been melded with this movie’s kaiju battles. The result would have been a better movie, but that’s not what <em>King of the Monsters</em> is, nor where its interests lie. This is a kaiju royal rumble. It’s about iconic monsters squaring off, sizing each other up, and fighting. That is what <em>King of the Monsters</em> is. And in the end, that’s all it needs to be.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"gnaj2d4aslfoeeofnlaw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://gnaj2d4aslfoeeofnlaw\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"352\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"gnaj2d4aslfoeeofnlaw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://gnaj2d4aslfoeeofnlaw\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"352\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/b84wwrgvklgh2snrlu9m.jpg', 'etc', 'https://kotaku.com/godzilla-the-king-of-the-monsters-the-kotaku-review-1835058558', 'It’s fitting that the first few minutes of Godzilla: King of the Monsters are a ...', NULL);

Hollywood has an abysmal track record with video game movies, but this time, it seems to have pulled off the impossible: Making an enjoyable live-action Pokémon movie that will delight fans and non-fans alike.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong><em>This piece was first published on May 3, 2019. We’re bumping it today for the movie’s release.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Set mostly in Ryme City, where Pocket Monsters live alongside humans, the movie follows the game’s basic plot. While trying to find his missing father, a young man named Tim Goodman discovers he can talk to a crime-solving Pikachu. The central mystery isn’t only what happened to Tim’s father, but also, who is making the drug called “R” that makes Pokémon go berserk. <em>Detective Pikachu</em> follows a rather formulaic detective film plot but so does the original game. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 dlwqzz align--right js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"wquy8wijw0hyfvj9cpic\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wquy8wijw0hyfvj9cpic\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1501\" data-height=\"797\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:1501px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"wquy8wijw0hyfvj9cpic\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wquy8wijw0hyfvj9cpic\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1501\" data-height=\"797\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But <em>Detective Pikachu</em> doesn’t share the same burden that weighs down so many adaptations, whether that’s video game or anime. For example, one thing that continually plagues made-in-Japan anime and manga adaptations is how many fans want the live-action version to simply be that: the anime and manga brought to life, as is, with humans. This means that character costumes and attributes, which might look cool when drawn, get directly translated to live-action, often with awkward or off-putting results that do not look realistic but instead appear downright goofy. The other extreme is something like the <em>Attack on Titan</em> cinematic movies which completely disregard the character’s original designs for a localized version. <em>Detective Pikachu</em> takes a different approach. <br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"uov613tt72iytbqkllix\" data-recommend-id=\"image://uov613tt72iytbqkllix\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1912\" data-height=\"801\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"uov613tt72iytbqkllix\" data-recommend-id=\"image://uov613tt72iytbqkllix\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1912\" data-height=\"801\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The smartest thing Legendary Pictures did with <em>Detective Pikachu</em> was to not adapt <em>Red &amp; Blue</em> — or any mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game or the long-running anime. The expectations would be too high and inevitably end in tears. Instead, by starting with a spin-off, the filmmakers were able to adeptly sidestep those expectations for how characters should talk, look and dress, giving room for the actors to bring them to life. (The <em>Resident Evil</em> movies, the most successful video game cinematic franchise, previously took a similar approach: Don’t redo the games, but instead, create a cinematic universe based on the in-game one. <em>Detective Pikachu</em>, however, has a far better understanding of its source material.)<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 jXybyg align--left js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b7tflo5xvse093n6p9yi\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b7tflo5xvse093n6p9yi\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1443\" data-height=\"799\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:1443px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b7tflo5xvse093n6p9yi\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b7tflo5xvse093n6p9yi\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1443\" data-height=\"799\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The character of Tim Goodman from the game isn’t beloved like Ash from the anime. In both the game and the movie, he’s a former wanna-be trainer turned insurance salesman with a rotten relationship with his father; in the movie, Tim is actually far more interesting and well-drawn than the in-game original. Since the other lead character Lucy Stevens doesn’t appear in the game, there aren’t the same expectations placed on a, say, a live-action version of Misty. Lucy is an intern at a news network, sick of writing listicles and hungry to break a big story. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The makers of <em>Detective Pikachu </em>certainly appear eager to please, but it’s not through cheap visceral thrills. Instead, so much of the movie appears to be set on getting the world of Pokémon as right as a big-budget movie can.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In what must be a cinematic first, the movie adaptation is more fully realized than the game in scope and breadth. The 3DS vision of Ryme City is rather bland, especially compared to the movie’s incarnation, which looks like Neo-Tokyo meets Pokémon. The urban cityscape is filled with layered with Pokémon cameos and layered with Easter Eggs, advertising shops like Charizard’s BBQ and the quite-clever Snap Camera Shop. In comparison, the game’s Ryme City is bland, and interestingly, smacks of the movie’s first ho-hum location, the town of Leaventown.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ixmllscs10vgmte2tqvo\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ixmllscs10vgmte2tqvo\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1698\" data-height=\"800\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ixmllscs10vgmte2tqvo\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ixmllscs10vgmte2tqvo\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1698\" data-height=\"800\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Early in the picture, when Justice Smith as Tim Goodman is riding the train from Leaventown to Ryme City, a Lickitung sticks out its tongue and then proceeds to lick the side of his face, covering it in globs of salvia. It’s gross but played for laughs, which perfectly sums up what meeting Lickitung would actually be like. This also helps establish that these Pocket Monsters are living, breathing creatures. Some are creepy, others are cuddly, and a couple of them are truly menacing, but they’re all real.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Pokémon are well conceived and fascinating creatures, so the fact that the filmmakers have recognized that and are not content to simply rely on appearances, but have a deeper understanding of what the Pokémon can do, is why this adaptation works so well compared to Hollywood’s other superficial attempts. <em>Detective Pikachu</em> understands <em>Pokémon</em>. It’s why the film works.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 dlwqzz align--right js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"nawdaq9by8asgdbwbkfp\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nawdaq9by8asgdbwbkfp\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"811\" data-height=\"392\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" style=\"width:811px\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"nawdaq9by8asgdbwbkfp\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nawdaq9by8asgdbwbkfp\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"811\" data-height=\"392\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Often with movie adaptations, only the barest superficial elements from the source material are referenced on-screen. Characters kind of look how they do in the games or share the same barebones modus operandi, and that’s it. In <em>Detective Pikachu</em>, joke after joke centers around Pokémon, and major plot points hinge on the abilities of certain Pokémon, instead of only a series of hollow spot-them-if-you-can cameos, showing how much thought has gone into the production. The movie is acutely aware that it has two audiences: Pokémon fans and non-fans. Early on, there’s a quick and painless explanation of how catching Pokémon works. Even this is laced with smart quips that fans can appreciate. It’s clearly evident the filmmakers did their homework and are enjoying themselves. The world of <em>Pokémon</em> is fertile, and instead of simply scratching its surface, <em>Detective Pikachu</em> delights in going deeper.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Once Ryan Reynolds does make his entrance as the titular detective, the joke ratio does spike suddenly, with nearly every other line a zinger. Reynolds has proven himself one of the most enjoyable and likable actors of his generation, thanks to his ability to not only craft excellent jokes but to deliver them. This is a kid’s movie, so he’s not working blue like in <em>Deadpool</em>, fart and pee-pee jokes aside. The <em>Ted</em> for kids comparison is apt.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"hml55wnede7uow3he4ir\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hml55wnede7uow3he4ir\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1839\" data-height=\"798\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"hml55wnede7uow3he4ir\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hml55wnede7uow3he4ir\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1839\" data-height=\"798\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures brought in some of the best visual effects artists in the business. Director Rob Letterman cut his teeth on CG animation with films like <em>Shark Tale</em> and <em>Monsters vs. Aliens</em>. The filmmakers had the added plus of The Pokémon Company’s involvement, providing notes on the CG character designs. All of these parts came together in the final film and resulted in Pocket Monsters that didn’t feel like live-action translations, but instead, live-action versions.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The movie does take liberties with the game, introducing several huge set pieces, totally different motivations for the antagonist, a new ability for a truly powerful <em>Pokémon</em>, and a completely different ending. The original game has an unsatisfying, unresolved conclusion, whereas the movie adaptation attempts to wrap everything up. I found it awkward and unbelievable, but the rest of the movie was so much fun that this wasn’t a dealbreaker. The big reveal at the end did make me wonder how they’ll pull off the inevitable sequel. However they do, here’s hoping it packs the same fun.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"wdeyvjwnewvacwiodgut\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wdeyvjwnewvacwiodgut\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1306\" data-height=\"799\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"wdeyvjwnewvacwiodgut\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wdeyvjwnewvacwiodgut\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1306\" data-height=\"799\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', '2024-01-10 16:32:01', 'Detective Pikachu Is A Good Movie', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/jixw4ctuhg50cvvwdtyv.jpg', 'etc', 'https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-is-a-good-movie-1834466412', 'Based on the Nintendo 3DS game by the same name, Pokémon Detective Pikachu is th...', NULL);

The original console’s first controller, often nicknamed “<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_controller\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_controller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Duke</a></span>” for its comically large size, is remembered for just that: being enormous. Its followup, the “<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://xbox.fandom.com/wiki/Controller_S\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://xbox.fandom.com/wiki/Controller_S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Controller S</a></span>,” was serviceable but not particularly notable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But when Microsoft took its third stab at introducing a gamepad, it arguably struck gold. And now, like the Duke before it, the Xbox 360 controller has returned by way of Hyperkin’s officially licensed replica for PC and modern Xbox consoles, aptly named “Xenon,” after the Xbox 360’s processor. The result is an excellent controller with generous haptic response and solid build quality. It’s the return of an old friend for sure, but one whose price and missing features make it hard to recommend over a modern Xbox Wireless controller.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h74674\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>The return of a proven design</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Xbox 360’s controller felt great in the hands, wisely relegating the “black and white buttons” to the shoulders, where they served as bumpers typically actuated by the sides of your index fingers, freeing up your actual fingers for use on triggers. It made shooters more enjoyable and avoided the sort of fork grip of index and middle fingers usually required for PlayStation gamepads. And on PC, Xbox 360 controllers often worked more seamlessly via XInput than something like a DualShock 3, which usually required additional software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Xbox One and current wireless controllers have since replaced the 360, particularly as Microsoft no longer makes the 360 controller. And the current offering from Microsoft is both affordable and of great quality. So what are the advantages of the Xbox 360 gamepad in 2023? </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After spending the last two weeks primarily gaming on the Xenon on PC across a wide variety of genres, I’m happy to say that the comfort of this gamepad isn’t just nostalgia: This is a genuinely comfortable controller that <!-- -->feels better now that it doesn’t have the big battery pack that used to sit in the middle of the original. That extra space comes at the cost of wireless functionality, much like the original 360’s wired variant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But if the lack of wireless isn’t an issue for you, the Xenon feels less like a dated throwback than a rather modern option. The buttons are where they’re supposed to be and it’s as comfortable as the Xbox Wireless controller. In fact, I prefer the feel of the Xenon a bit more than the Xbox Wireless controller. I’ll address its shortcomings in a moment, but when playing recent releases on PC, I’m beginning to favor the Xenon over the modern Xbox controller, and not just for the shape alone. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ca21d80558a445f6f36caf61c30eba24\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ca21d80558a445f6f36caf61c30eba24\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A replica of an Xbox 360 controller sits on a table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ca21d80558a445f6f36caf61c30eba24\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ca21d80558a445f6f36caf61c30eba24\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A replica of an Xbox 360 controller sits on a table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h74675\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>A refreshing feel, thunderous rumble, and old-school vibes</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The first thing<!-- --> that stood out to me when I picked up the Xenon were the feel and motion of the analog sticks, which lack the rigid tire-like texture that lines the edges of current Xbox controllers.

Were this not a replica controller, I would argue for redesigning the d-pad altogether, but it does feel snappier than the original. You won’t catch me playing <em>Street Fighter 6</em> with this, but it will make for an acceptably average d-pad experience on games that don’t require heavy use of such a thing. <br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Xenon Wired Controller\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"xenon-wired-controller\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The triggers, which are far more narrow than what you’d have on almost any modern controller, also feel particularly at home for shooters. They resemble real gun triggers far more than what’s on the standard Xbox controller. That said, I didn’t enjoy that feeling for racing games, where the more narrow pressure against my index finger, since there’s less surface area, didn’t feel as nice.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"be585ff690deefb06874e0eb9d5da2cb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://be585ff690deefb06874e0eb9d5da2cb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The reverse side of a replica Xbox 360 controller shows the triggers.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"be585ff690deefb06874e0eb9d5da2cb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://be585ff690deefb06874e0eb9d5da2cb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The reverse side of a replica Xbox 360 controller shows the triggers.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But perhaps my favorite feature is the rumble. God does this thing feel great when it vibrates. Explosions have a nice kick and gunfire rumbles in my hand and gives me absolute joy. Sure, more contemporary haptic vibration methods like what’s in the PlayStation 5’s DualSense are nice, but offset weights spinning on motors in a plastic case is a kind of fun that I don’t think will ever get old. The rumble feels stronger than what the Xbox Wireless controller delivers, though that’s a hard metric to measure precisely.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Also, the buttons are fully colored coded. That may not seem like an obvious advantage, but consider that the standard Xbox Wireless controller only colors the letters on the buttons, and for the fancier editions, they’re all <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/remix-special-edition\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/remix-special-edition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uniformly muted</a></span>. Video games are meant to be fun, and it’s nice to see fun colors on a gamepad. I primarily played on a black Xenon controller, and having the yellow, red, green, and blue jewel buttons pop made me feel like I was picking up something exciting to play, not an attempt at<!-- --> trying to look industrial or utilitarian. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"63609a3d41bce5f00165b982b7411a6e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://63609a3d41bce5f00165b982b7411a6e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Black and red Xbox 360 replica controllers sit on a wooden table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"63609a3d41bce5f00165b982b7411a6e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://63609a3d41bce5f00165b982b7411a6e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Black and red Xbox 360 replica controllers sit on a wooden table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Xenon comes in black, pink, white, and red. Each with matching colored USB cables. The red is the only odd one as it has gray sides and triggers, which is kind of an eyesore. Meanwhile, the white is very faithful to the launch 360 model (though the black menu buttons sort of mar that). That leaves the pink and black as probably the best <!-- -->of the current Xenon color offerings. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h74676\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>At $50, the wired Xenon nearly competes with the Xbox Wireless controller</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">How much do you value nostalgia? Because when it comes to Xenon, you’re gonna need to keep that in mind. At MSRP, the Xenon controller is $10 less than a standard Xbox wireless controller (which starts at around $60 and goes up for limited edition colors). But if you shop at Amazon or most online retailers (including directly from Microsoft’s store), it’s not uncommon to find a standard Xbox gamepad for $10 off, meaning that the Xenon and Xbox Wireless Controller are often the same price. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If the Xbox 360 controller was your jam and you don’t care about wireless, the answer’s probably clear: This is a faithful recreation and an excellent execution of the form factor. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Personally? Wires don’t bother me. I’m often within three feet of my PC tower and less than that when on my laptop, so a wire is fine for me. Still, you may differ on that, especially if you’re a console player. In that case, even the 10 ft. USB-C cable that comes with the Xenon might not be enough—and it’s not quite cheap enough to be the dedicated “I-don’t-care-what-happens-to-this-here-player-2” gamepad you fish out of a drawer when you’re labored with company who want to game. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f7f370aa869b059b46b521a6d351f91a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f7f370aa869b059b46b521a6d351f91a\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Three Xbox 360 replica controllers, one pink, one white, and one black, sit on a wooden table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f7f370aa869b059b46b521a6d351f91a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f7f370aa869b059b46b521a6d351f91a\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Three Xbox 360 replica controllers, one pink, one white, and one black, sit on a wooden table.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even though it doesn’t bother me, the lack of wireless is a friggin’ buzzkill.

I’d gladly take some slightly wider triggers, more textured thumbsticks, and a better d-pad design (honestly, even the “satellite dish” design of the current Xbox Wireless controller would be a step up) fused with this overall shape.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Xenon, overall, is a great controller that easily meets modern standards of gaming. The lack of wireless sucks, and its price is too close to the standard Xbox Wireless controller to suggest you’ll save money by reattaching the cord. That said, the price of entry gets you a new Xbox 360 controller for PC and modern Xboxes, and that’s something that just might be worth a tether and dated d-pad design.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', 'Replica Xbox 360 Controller Nails The Vibes, But Lack Of Wireless Hurts', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/2357149bd16d27a3b4938d52aa5dcc96.jpg', 'controllers', 'https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-controller-xenon-hyperkin-pc-gamepad-1850545502', 'The Xbox’s gamepad wasn’t a hit right out of the gate.

I purchased it in the Before Times thinking it’d make for a great subway companion. But between the short battery life and it being uncomfortable to hold for long periods, I just didn’t ever want to play it much. But there might finally be some light on my Switch’s horizon. Over the last few weeks I’ve been testing Hori’s new Split Pad Compact controller. While it has some cool unique features of its own, the best part might be the way that it’s encouraged me to spend more time with my Switch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Hori’s Split Pad Compact is the successor to its prior Split Pad Pro. Taking the place of traditional Nintendo Joy-Cons, its two halves slot into the usual spaces for portable play on a standard Switch. The Compact’s colors, shape, and general playability have won me over, but it comes with some major caveats: no rumble, no wireless, and no motion-sensing features. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is an unfortunate trend among many third-party Switch controllers given the variety of proprietary tech Nintendo employs on the console. That might entirely rule out the Split Pad Compact for some games, or for players who (justifiably) find those features essential to the Switch. But if you’ve wanted to check out an alternative to the standard Joy-Con that makes for, in my opinion, a way more comfortable portable experience, the $50 MSRP isn’t too bad for such a thing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The buttons and design also feel rather at home with the Switch. These don’t feel like Xbox or PlayStation buttons. They sit a little bit taller than on a regular Joy-Con, but the trade-off is that I find them a bit more tactile. The analog thumbsticks are much closer to full-size ones (thank god), and overall it has a nice “Nintendo-y” feeling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Split Pad Compact is far from the only ergonomically shaped Switch controller (or grip) out there. What really sets it apart in terms of function are the back buttons. These buttons aren’t going to rival an Xbox Elite controller’s paddles, as there are only two of them, but I kinda like it that way. There’s also a turbo feature which lets you rapid-fire a button of your choice. In the games I played, I found little utility with this; turbo will appeal more to those into older-style action games, or RPGs where you have to page through a million text boxes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"bebe951e8acc0e5fb8d745011134f7ae\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bebe951e8acc0e5fb8d745011134f7ae\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The rear functions of the Hori Split Pad Compact have handy assignable buttons. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"bebe951e8acc0e5fb8d745011134f7ae\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bebe951e8acc0e5fb8d745011134f7ae\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The rear functions of the Hori Split Pad Compact have handy assignable buttons. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Assigning a face button to either of the two rear inputs is a simple three-button combo. You hold down “Assign,” along with the button you wish to map (the capture and home buttons aren’t allowed), then click the rear button you want to assign to; the light will stay on as a solid red to indicate you’ve done it right. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries, but eventually you get the feel for it. There are no profiles for different games, which is a bummer. Switching up button remaps is easy though once you get it, and there are only two back buttons at most to worry about anyway. But there’s another critical limitation here.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Each rear button can only be assigned to the buttons that are on the individual “Joy-Con” itself. Basically, the right back button can only be assigned A, B, X, Y, since they are on the right-side unit. The left button can only activate buttons on the left-hand side. </p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Hori Split Pad Compact\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"hori-split-pad-compact\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While I initially grimaced at the rear inputs being limited thus, I ended up finding some great utility in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. After playing this game with the Hori, I’ve come to realize that, OK, weapons breaking ain’t so bad; what was most annoying was actually just having to move my thumb from stick to d-pad for a mid-battle swap, which sort of slows down the pace. Mapping the weapon menu to a rear button neatly resolves this. Much nicer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I also revisited the remastered version of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>—you know, the one with the damn digital movement controls that completely wreck the experience, which I will never shut up about. It hardly requires fast button combos (outside of a few sequences) or really even needs a back button; but the shape of the Split Pad Compact fits so much better in my hands that reading through its endless gray text boxes is just a more pleasant way to physically play. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"6468a85d895ad0a9b9b65b07f8186f50\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6468a85d895ad0a9b9b65b07f8186f50\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Nintendo Switch with Hori Split Pad Compact controllers sits on a couple of Switch games.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"6468a85d895ad0a9b9b65b07f8186f50\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6468a85d895ad0a9b9b65b07f8186f50\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Nintendo Switch with Hori Split Pad Compact controllers sits on a couple of Switch games.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A few smaller, indie games have come and gone during my time with the Split Pad Compact. I also put in more time with <em>Metroid Dread</em>. The added hand real estate of the slightly larger Hori controller just made it more enjoyable. My Switch feels like a mini Steam Deck now, as opposed to the more horizontal phablet experience the stock Joy-Cons make for.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m not always using the Hori’s advanced features, like turbo and the rear buttons, but what I am doing is playing my damn Switch. Regularly even!</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And that simplicity, the feeling of these things just sort of getting out of your way so you can have a more comfortable experience on the Switch is the best part of this new controller. (Oh, and in case you’re wondering, yes, according to Hori, these work on both the original Switch and OLED models). The inherent limitations of zero rumble support, no wireless functionality, and no motion sensing will be clear deal breakers in many cases. But if, like me, you’ve found the Switch something of an ergonomic horrorshow, you might find the Hori Split Pad Compact a pretty great excuse to start playing it again, even if you just want to catch up on the many hits this console’s enjoyed in your absence. </p>', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', 'The Next Time You\'re Looking For New Switch Joy-Con, Check These Out', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f68a38521d4c94e2b8aa702c38fc2d1d.jpg', 'controllers', 'https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-joy-con-hori-controller-gamepad-zelda-1849601824', 'My Nintendo Switch largely sat unplayed for the duration of the pandemic.

Or you might be interested in trying out more modern pro controller features like assignable rear buttons and adjustable trigger ranges, but aren’t yet ready to spend over a hundred dollars on an Xbox Elite or Scuf controller.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are any number of reasons for looking into cheaper controllers, and here I’m going to lay out the pros and cons of some of the most common options out there for Xbox and PC. While the 8BitDo Ultimate Wired controller stands out as my personal favorite here, each of these might be more or less compelling to you for different reasons. The “best budget controller” title is going to come down to what your needs are.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The good news is that if you’re looking to save some money, you can in fact get a great budget gamepad on Xbox or PC. Most of the devices on this list are solid enough to use as your main controller, and any of these can serve as a suitable backup for when your main controller gives into the inevitable entropy known as “Drift.”</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But as we’re talking about budget controllers, we ought to set some expectations for the one potentially deal-breaking limitation that these all have.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If wireless is make or break for you, you’re gonna have to buy a more expensive gamepad than anything here. Wireless functionality is something that none of these controllers (even my favorite of this lot) have. Because of Microsoft’s proprietary wireless technology, that feature is limited to official Xbox controllers from Microsoft and select others. But don’t close your browser yet! I get it, we’ve been with wireless as a standard now since the Xbox 360, so why would you want to go back? Well, there are a few reasons.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’re a PC gamer, wireless might not be that big of a deal as your machine could be close enough for it not to matter. And while a cable certainly sucks for chilling on the couch and playing some Xbox, most of these have what I’d consider to be a sufficient amount of length for average scenarios, and the cables are certainly as long as anything you’d probably get packaged in a more expensive, wireless controller. In some cases you can purchase longer cables if you desire.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Honestly, if it’s a backup controller you’re looking for, having a reliable wired gamepad might be a decent thing to stick in a drawer for a rainy day, or spontaneous couch co-op.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Also, none of these are speciality controllers (though one does straddle the line between modern design and retro-novelty). These aren’t fighting gamepads, or retro-style ones with functions reserved for silicon dinosaurs of past generations. These all focus on the functions necessary for your average AAA game. You can play any modern game on these with all the buttons supported and few extra functions that you don’t need. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I played entirely on PC to test these gamepads out, either on games in the Xbox app or Steam. Steam is kind of like a skeleton key of controller compatibility (especially if you launch it in Big Picture mode). I had no issues with all but one of these controllers, and they are all certified to work on an Xbox console.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', 'The 5 Best Budget Controllers For Xbox And PC', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/cd10640b4cf433cf509e4a8393ed43bf.jpg', 'controllers', 'https://kotaku.com/xbox-pc-gamepad-turtle-beach-hyperkin-powera-hori-8bitd-1849545811', 'The current Xbox Core controller might be one of the best Microsoft has produced...', NULL);

The company has <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://scufgaming.com/patents\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://scufgaming.com/patents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an entire page of its website dedicated to its patents</a></span>. You know the Xbox Elite Controller from Microsoft? Most of the tech that makes it so elite was licensed from Scuf. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Scuf was purchased by Corsair Components in 2019, making it an integral part of Corsair’s evil gaming hardware empire, which also includes Origin PC and streaming device maker Elgato. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h174\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>What is the Scuf Instinct Pro controller? </strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://scufgaming.com/xbox-scuf-instinct\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://scufgaming.com/xbox-scuf-instinct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scuf Instinct Pro</a></span> is a combination wired and wireless controller designed for the PC and Xbox Series X/S consoles. It’s Scuf’s latest take on making its own Xbox Elite Wireless controller. There are actually two models of Instinct. There’s the $200 Instinct Pro, which comes with trigger stops and textured grips, and the $170 non-pro Instinct, which lacks those two features. </p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"545b3e952b3e653e5a1a1ce05d6558be\" data-recommend-id=\"image://545b3e952b3e653e5a1a1ce05d6558be\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The rear view of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller, showing off its new back buttons. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"545b3e952b3e653e5a1a1ce05d6558be\" data-recommend-id=\"image://545b3e952b3e653e5a1a1ce05d6558be\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The rear view of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller, showing off its new back buttons. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Both Instinct models feature four buttons on the back of the controller. Those are Scuf’s beloved patent babies. They used to be long metal paddles, but now they’re cute little buttons easily activated by your middle fingers. Beneath the battery compartment—yes, the Instinct Pro uses batteries instead of a rechargeable battery pack—there’s a button for quickly switching between three different button configuration profiles. The little silver switches beside the battery bay lock the controller’s triggers so they don’t have to travel to activate, which is nice for shooters.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"e8c8836c3965b36a8c9852b54cc704b2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e8c8836c3965b36a8c9852b54cc704b2\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of Scuf\'s Instinct Pro with a green faceplate. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e8c8836c3965b36a8c9852b54cc704b2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e8c8836c3965b36a8c9852b54cc704b2\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of Scuf\'s Instinct Pro with a green faceplate. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The front of the Scuf Instinct Pro looks a lot like your standard Xbox Series X/S controller, down to the share button and the one-piece directional disc. There’s an additional dedicated mute button for headset users, which is lovely.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h175\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>How does the Scuf Instinct Pro controller feel? </strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What really sets the Scuf Instinct Pro apart from the standard Xbox Series X/S controllers is the removable faceplate. Not only does it allow for you to switch up the look of the controller with different covers and analog stick rings, you can also swap the analog sticks for different sizes and shapes. There are a couple of convex sticks included in the package, which I immediately threw away because convex sticks are garbage.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"1891274c167ee85fc1495c21a683b8ef\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1891274c167ee85fc1495c21a683b8ef\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller with its white faceplate removed. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"1891274c167ee85fc1495c21a683b8ef\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1891274c167ee85fc1495c21a683b8ef\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"600\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller with its white faceplate removed. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Aside from those groovy little back buttons, the Scuf Instinct Pro controller feels like an official Xbox controller with a textured grip. The form factor is pretty much the same as my standard Xbox Series X/S game pads. Despite its modular design, the Instinct Pro has a nice, solid feel to it. The weight is nice. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I was worried the little buttons on the back wouldn’t be as satisfying as the metal paddles from older Scuf models or Microsoft’s Elite Wireless Controller, but they’re actually decent and unobtrusive. You can feel them there, but they don’t feel like they’re in the way. </p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h176\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Is the Scuf Instinct Pro controller better than the standard Xbox Series X/S controller? </strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’re looking for extra features, more buttons, and customization options, the Instinct Pro has the original Xbox Series X/S controller beat hands down. If you don’t need any of those things, the standard controller should do you just fine.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h177\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Is the Scuf Instinct Pro controller better than the Elite Wireless 2 controller?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is a much tougher call. For one, Microsoft’s Elite Wireless 2 costs $20 less than the $200 Instinct Pro. The Elite Wireless 2 has multiple hair trigger stops as opposed to the Instinct Pro’s, which are either on or off. And the Elite Wireless 2 has adjustable analog stick tension, which the Instinct Pro does not. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"16b38679c6f4c8b3fcac3edda8dd5376\" data-recommend-id=\"image://16b38679c6f4c8b3fcac3edda8dd5376\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller in a giant, mutant hand. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"16b38679c6f4c8b3fcac3edda8dd5376\" data-recommend-id=\"image://16b38679c6f4c8b3fcac3edda8dd5376\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A photo of the Scuf Instinct Pro controller in a giant, mutant hand. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That said, I do prefer the little nubby buttons on the back of the Instinct Pro, and my custom faceplate is so much prettier than the Elite Wireless 2. If you want to make a statement with your controller, the Instinct Pro is the way to go.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h178\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Should you buy the Scuf Instinct Pro controller?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Look folks, I am not going to tell you what to do with your money. If it were up to me you’d be spending it all on transforming robots from Japan shipped directly to my front door. What I will say is that if you drop $200 on Scuf’s fancy new Xbox Series X/S and/or PC controller, I do not think you will be disappointed. It’s a solid pro-grade controller that feels like something Microsoft might make, and not just because Scuf owns most of the patents on what Microsoft makes anyway. </p>', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', '2024-01-10 16:37:48', 'The Scuf Instinct Pro Feels Like An Official Xbox Controller', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/dd8d98f5c587b2286cac7b35a28248da.jpg', 'controllers', 'https://kotaku.com/the-scuf-instinct-pro-feels-like-an-official-xbox-contr-1847553968', 'Since 2011, Scuf Gaming has made a name for itself by producing some of the high...', NULL);

These are not flimsy third-party shells—they are Nintendo hardware with a little something extra. Compared to unpainted Joy-Cons, they feel slightly thicker and quite smoother. Due to the thickness of the added paint they fit to the Switch more snugly, making the system feel more solid in handheld mode. The bumpers are lovely but incredibly tight, which is fine because eventually I will lose them in a drawer.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"l3umyizirldd29uklihl\" data-recommend-id=\"image://l3umyizirldd29uklihl\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"900\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"l3umyizirldd29uklihl\" data-recommend-id=\"image://l3umyizirldd29uklihl\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"900\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If choosing between a ton of different colors and gloss levels is too difficult, Colorware also offers a variety of limited edition Joy-Cons, as well as fully-painted Switch consoles.

Meanwhile, on consoles, we get this. </p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"xplgd1zxcxzcmbauf5q8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://xplgd1zxcxzcmbauf5q8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"xplgd1zxcxzcmbauf5q8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://xplgd1zxcxzcmbauf5q8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"1200\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The LEDs in the Afterglow Wireless Deluxe Controller do not react to my on-screen actions. They don’t flash when Scorbunny evolves into Raboot. They don’t dim when I am approaching a trainer battle. They do cycle, and they can be set to any number of colors using the unit’s function and shoulder buttons. They can even be switched off, revealing a lovely, well-built, translucent skeleton of a controller. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"z6urrd3rbnurs8ycfsbk\" data-recommend-id=\"image://z6urrd3rbnurs8ycfsbk\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"900\" data-height=\"675\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"z6urrd3rbnurs8ycfsbk\" data-recommend-id=\"image://z6urrd3rbnurs8ycfsbk\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"900\" data-height=\"675\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Unlike many third-party wireless controllers for the Switch, the Afterglow supports motion control, though not any sort of rumble.

The controller’s 20-hour battery life means I can have a randomly glowing piece of hardware on my desk for a nice long time before having to plug it in for more hot glowing action. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But really, I’m just here for the glow.

Often there’s an assumption that a review will be a spoiler-free assessment of whether or not something is worth your time, keeping its distance and speaking in broad generalities. But sometimes, you need to engage with what a work is really doing in order to say anything meaningful about it, and I don’t think talking around the specifics of <em>Slay the Princess </em>will do it justice. Anyway, I pretty much already did that already when I <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-demo-pax-east-steam-black-tabby-games-1850269750\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-demo-pax-east-steam-black-tabby-games-1850269750\">previewed the game earlier this year</a></span>. So if you want to know if you should play <em>Slay the Princess</em>, the answer is yes. If you want to know why, read on.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"88\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"88\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Slay the Princess </em>appears pretty single-minded in the beginning. You’re thrust into a situation with no context, walking through a forest toward a cabin where a princess who allegedly will destroy the world is being kept at bay by a single chain around her wrist. It’s up to you to slay her and save everyone. You’re told all this by a narrator who refuses to elaborate on some of the most basic information. How is she going to destroy the world? Does she even want to? Does her apparent capability to destroy the world mean she must die?</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All of these questions spin through my head as I enter the cabin. There’s a knife sitting on a table, but little else hints at my grim task until I descend the stairs and find the princess chained up. I had already tried to talk to her in the original demo, so I thought I’d shake up my strategy this time and not entertain having a conversation at all. Instead, I walked right up to her, used the blade I’d picked up on the way in, and stabbed her without hesitation. Then I made the mistake of removing the blade, and she stabbed me with her own weapon. As we both bled out on the floor of the dungeon, we were caught in the loop of our creator’s design.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"dcc68f2082c4163d1384cb7b058e864b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://dcc68f2082c4163d1384cb7b058e864b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'The Princess stands with a missing hand.

Every question I ask about the apparent loop I’m in sparks more confusion between me, the narrator, and the literal voices in my head. But nevertheless, I head back into the cabin and find it’s not quite as I remember it. There’s a mirror on the wall that disappears when I try to look into it, the stairwell isn’t quite as I remember it, and the princess has evolved into a monstrous version of herself. This loop repeats itself, with the princess appearing in different, terrifying forms each time, until the princess and I find ourselves in a strange pocket dimension between the loops, able to talk without the narrator there to tell us what to do.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In this in-between space, <em>Slay the Princess</em> gets existential. The princess is essentially absorbing each variation of her we meet in these time loops to find new understanding. Each possibility is a different version of who she could be based on the slightest alterations to how I reach her in the dungeon. She acknowledges that each version of her is <em>her</em>, but by experiencing all these realities, she is able to gain a greater understanding of who she is and who she can be. She grows beyond what the narrator has told her she is, but acknowledges that certain parts of her are inherent, and others are determined by what happens to her in a loop.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Slay the Princess\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"slay-the-princess\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">She asks that I continue to go through the loop to bring her new perspectives, and so I do it. I pick different dialogue options that determine which version of the princess I’ll find in the dungeon, and by the end, I’d brought her so many variants that she had transcended the understanding the narrator had spouted off at the beginning of each cycle. Even if I wasn’t mesmerized by the existentialism and stellar prose of Black Tabby Games’ writing, the reveal of what kind of horrific monstrosity the princess would appear as on each loop was motivation enough to keep running down the stairs into the dungeon again and again.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sometimes the princess would just appear as a very tall version of herself towering over me, while at others she would be a vicious, blade-bearing terror. There was even a time when she’d taken the form of animals, circling around me in the darkness as if I were her prey. Sometimes I slayed her, other times she slayed me. Eventually, however, as her understanding grew, the narrator’s control over the situation shattered– literally, as the mirror that kept appearing between loops broke, showing pieces of this previously unseen figure’s appearance in its cracked shards. Though the image is broken, I’m able to see that the narrator is bird-like, and is apparently responsible for the creation of the princess, who is meant to embody destruction, death, and the rebirth that comes after.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"c9fa3fcc8cc239d778b49690d73f48ff\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c9fa3fcc8cc239d778b49690d73f48ff\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'The narrator speaks through a shattered mirror, saying \"Because among other things, she is death itself.

If death is a frightening, debilitating concept to you, the princess becomes a monster. If you approach it without fear, she will appear as an approachable human being. Thus the multiversal cycle we find ourselves in now. The simulation the narrator has put us in means we can follow every permutation to its natural conclusion, but now that the princess is aware of what she is, there’s a new conundrum. If she is allowed to exist as the god of destruction she was designed to be, she can escape this construct and lay waste to the outside world.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">With the mirror that embodied him broken, the narrator is not long for this world, and you interrogating him in his final moments makes for <em>Slay the Princess</em>’ most memorable scene. As you ask each question, pieces of the mirror you’re looking at disappear, taking the narrator with it. I quickly realize I have more dialogue options than pieces of the mirror, and the stakes of each question I choose to ask grow much higher. There’s no time to get too inquisitive, as I only have a limited amount of time with the game’s info dump. But as I talk to him, it becomes very clear the narrator has a specific vision of who the princess is, and who I should be. He spends the entire conversation warning me about the dangers of an entity he created that has long been shaped by others’ perceptions of her. As far as he’s concerned, her existence, the threat of death and destruction, is what keeps people from being without fear. Is her life worth a burdenless existence for the rest of the world?<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I can ask all the questions I want, but in the end, it will just be me and the princess here to decide what’s next. She has ascended to godhood, and I can either leave this simulation with her as gods and play out what the narrator feared, or you can rewind the entire scenario, and talk to each other as a princess in a dungeon and her would-be assassin and choose to leave it as people, rather than gods.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"fb39fd5569795242ede2bf466a0c5b9d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://fb39fd5569795242ede2bf466a0c5b9d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The Princess\' true form, made up of multiple iterations of her grafted onto her body, says &quot;I can finally see you, and you can finally see me.&quot;\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"fb39fd5569795242ede2bf466a0c5b9d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://fb39fd5569795242ede2bf466a0c5b9d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The Princess\' true form, made up of multiple iterations of her grafted onto her body, says &quot;I can finally see you, and you can finally see me.&quot;\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There’s a lot of minutiae in the space between <em>Slay the Princess</em>’ multiple endings, but while much of the conversation around Black Tabby Games’ visual novel is around the various, monstrous forms the princess takes in each loop, all I can think about is this final cycle. Whichever sequences of events you choose to follow, it’s here that you and the princess finally see each other for what you actually are. This is both as gods meant to embody ideas, but also as people, long-beholden to the views of your creator, and the hypothetical threats you pose to the people outside this construct.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Slay the Princess </em>is all about time loops, mind-bending twists, and terrifying character design, but at its center, it is about being seen for who you really are, rather than what can be summed up in a second-hand account of what you’re perceived to be. The first time I played through the ending, I chose to have the princess and I leave the construct as gods, believing death was part of the human experience that makes life worth living. But after replaying it, I chose to find the princess in her chains once again, and to free her from the cycle entirely, leaving as ourselves.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This world we live in is so often depersonalizing, feeling dismissive of everything we individually want and believe ourselves to be, as we’re so often in the vice grip of what others want or believe us to be. Our employers try to quantify our usefulness on spreadsheets and we seek validation from strangers to tell ourselves we are worthy of love, all of which contribute to a distorted and potentially false reflection of who we are, what we believe, and our own self-worth. The way others view us defines our day-to-day, but only if we let it.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b4c7f2386f7851db4ad454fd5cc22859\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b4c7f2386f7851db4ad454fd5cc22859\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The princess approaches the exit to the cabin.

It should be so cathartic to play a game where you can remove yourself from a cycle like this, but it only makes me wish it felt possible to be so clearly understood and free from the shackles of others’ visions of who you are in the real world. <em>Slay the Princess </em>instills hope in me that such freedom exists and despair at just how tired I am in equal measure. But at least it makes me believe in possibilities, even if they might take a few loops to see to the end.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', 'You Need To Play This Brilliant New Time-Loop Horror Game', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/503d61a0cfdcec8caa216a2ea0aed590.jpg', 'pc', 'https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-review-black-tabby-games-horror-1851000305', 'I’m not interested in just vaguely gesturing at what Slay the Princess, a horror...', NULL);

The first part makes <em>Holstin</em>’s target atmosphere obvious, trapping you in 1992 Poland, in a small, wood-paneled home made more smothering by occasional crashes of thunder coming from outside. The house has been overtaken by a mysterious <em>ooze</em>—patches of tumored, flesh-pink tendrils that deplete your health if you touch them, but retreat once you turn on the lights.<br></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h80053\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em><strong>Holstin</strong></em><strong> offers a 3D puzzle</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You, a man with deep frown lines, don’t know what’s happening.

I rotate the isometric camera to find more secrets in its eight possible angles, like obscured entryways or helpful lamp locations.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This can occasionally be frustrating (like when I couldn’t click on an important item until fiddling with the camera for a good five minutes) and, for me, often nauseating—games easily make me motion sick.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But I can imagine horror game enthusiasts less prone to dizzy spells and more efficient at solving puzzles will find the camera design uniquely engaging.

In my case, it was the <em>GameSpot </em>forums of the early 2000s. There, I found people I could share my love of games with, as well as get into deep discussions and sometimes heated debates about the state of the world. It was a place where I could explore myself in ways that I couldn’t in the “real world,” and for a period of my life, it was essential to my existence. The new game <em>Videoverse </em>takes place in a fictional online community in late 2003, but creator Kinmoku Games (who were also behind <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/video-game-about-a-one-night-stand-is-as-awkward-as-it-1788830186\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/video-game-about-a-one-night-stand-is-as-awkward-as-it-1788830186\">2016’s excellent <em>One Night Stand</em></a></span>) imbues it with so much authenticity and character that it feels remarkably alive. If you once found a home in just such an online space, I suspect <em>Videoverse </em>will resonate with your memories of the internet as it once was. And if you didn’t, there’s enough tenderness and humanity to <em>Videoverse</em>’s world to make it a worthwhile glimpse into experiences you never had.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h75979\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The way we were</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Videoverse </em>takes place almost entirely within the titular online community, a collection of message boards frequented by owners of the fictional Kinmoku Shark. As you navigate Videoverse, you’ll spot details reminiscent of Xbox 360-era gamer profiles, as well as ads that feel true to the spirit and style of early 2000s video game advertising–al<!-- -->ways energetic, occasionally embarrassing. The in-game Videoverse draws on a hodgepodge of influences, but its closest real-life parallel is probably <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-shut-down-the-miiverse-tonight-as-fans-said-fi-1820241055\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/nintendo-shut-down-the-miiverse-tonight-as-fans-said-fi-1820241055\">Miiverse, the now-defunct online community Nintendo created alongside its own ill-fated Wii U</a></span>. Like Miiverse, the fictional Videoverse sports communities for different games, and text posts that people write exist alongside art drawn and submitted for the approval (or derision) of their fellow users.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And indeed, the Miiverse parallel feels apt as well because Videoverse users increasingly suspect that the service’s days may be numbered. Kinmoku has recently launched a new console, the Dolphin (I see what you did there), and there’s a feeling, growing stronger with every day, that the console maker is likely going to pull the plug on Videoverse soon, encouraging fans to upgrade to the new device and its online community (which, unlike Videoverse, requires a subscription fee).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"e9547630d9c1525399a3c0ce1b0a88b0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e9547630d9c1525399a3c0ce1b0a88b0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Emmett and his friend Markus chat about the game Feudal Fantasy while smiling at each other. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e9547630d9c1525399a3c0ce1b0a88b0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e9547630d9c1525399a3c0ce1b0a88b0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Emmett and his friend Markus chat about the game Feudal Fantasy while smiling at each other. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In the midst of all this, you play as Emmett, a teenager who lives in Germany and has aspirations of becoming a video game artist. The Shark may be on its last legs (???) but it’s going out with one last hurrah, a blockbuster called <em>Feudal Fantasy</em>. Yes, its name is an obvious homage to Square Enix’s similarly named series, but <em>Feudal Fantasy </em>is also very much its own thing, and throughout the course of <em>Videoverse</em>, you’ll witness key cutscenes in this Japanese-history-inspired epic melodrama as Emmett plays through it.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Naturally, one of the most active boards on Videoverse is the one devoted to <em>Feudal Fantasy</em>, a place where Emmett and other players not only passionately discuss the game but also share fan art. Much of this art aims to capture the game’s iconic characters in moments of heightened intensity, but I particularly appreciated the more playful fan art, like those that good-naturedly ribbed the game’s lack of historical accuracy or its sometimes-awkward localization. One drawing, by Emmett’s friend Markus, shows <em>Feudal Fantasy </em>hero Hanzo<strong> </strong>holding a chocolate bar and asking, “This is feudal Japan?” while another character’s contribution shows a hamburger labeled as RAMEN.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9e2836b00a9900a5703c50c63a3e32f8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9e2836b00a9900a5703c50c63a3e32f8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"In the Feudal Fantasy community, someone has posted an image of a hamburger with the word RAMEN next to it.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9e2836b00a9900a5703c50c63a3e32f8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9e2836b00a9900a5703c50c63a3e32f8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"In the Feudal Fantasy community, someone has posted an image of a hamburger with the word RAMEN next to it.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">These are fictional details about a fictional game, of course, but they feel precise and authentic, making it easier for us to fully invest ourselves in the world of <em>Videoverse </em>and to understand the experiences of these players, even though we only view them through the window of these message boards. And <em>Videoverse </em>is full of such details. Kinmoku (the real-life devs of <em>Videoverse</em>, that is, not the fictional in-game console maker) know this cultural territory inside and out, and do an exemplary job of crafting a believable online space here.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h75980\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Human connection in a digital realm</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But an online space is nothing without the people who populate it. The center of <em>Videoverse</em>’s story involves Emmett’s connection with a mysterious newcomer to the boards whose own <em>Feudal Fantasy </em>fan art leaves him awed and intrigued. As he and this person, who goes by the handle Vivi, communicate and open up to each other, Emmett learns a great deal–about his own privilege; about what he hopes to do with his future; about how much the connections that Videoverse allows him really mean, and what an impact they’ve had on his life. Kinmoku is working with themes that will resonate with many who formed meaningful online connections in their youth, and then saw the spaces that enabled those connections disappear as the internet evolved.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That central storyline is compelling and builds up to a poignant conclusion (or at least it did in my playthrough–I think there are a few possible endings depending on the choices you make). But it’s the supporting ensemble of names and faces you encounter all over the boards, and the little heartwarming exchanges, the silly bits of chit-chat and video game in-jokes, and the fierce disputes they all engage in, that really make the game sing. More than once I was struck by revelations or personality clashes I witnessed that made me feel like I’d stepped right back into my own bygone forum days. Sometimes, a person will offer up a hint of some trouble happening in their home life or some other struggle they’re experiencing, and I really felt for them.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"71f177bb4bd97312dc29714fdf0493d1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://71f177bb4bd97312dc29714fdf0493d1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"In a reference to Majora\'s Mask, a giant moon with a spooky face is seen looking down in a piece of art on the &quot;art corner community&quot; board, along with the words NOT MUCH TIME.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"71f177bb4bd97312dc29714fdf0493d1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://71f177bb4bd97312dc29714fdf0493d1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"In a reference to Majora\'s Mask, a giant moon with a spooky face is seen looking down in a piece of art on the &quot;art corner community&quot; board, along with the words NOT MUCH TIME.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Online connections can be strange, can’t they? The way you can feel simultaneously close and distant, understanding that what appears to you as just a name on a screen is a person with their own life and their own hardships, all of which exist beyond the bounds of the space you share. You can tell that the makers of <em>Videoverse </em>really gave some thought to who each of these forum posters are as people—they each have their own voice, their own interests, and sometimes their own challenges, which you can respond to with sensitivity and support, or disdain if you prefer.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You shape Emmett’s personality by choosing possible responses to posts on the boards from a few different options. I never felt too limited by this–there was usually an option that mirrored my own reactions closely enough, and when, in certain interactions, a choice was unavailable to me because my Emmett was “not cocky enough,” I always felt, “Yep, that’s right, my Emmett definitely would not say that!” You can also interact with the boards by doing things like customizing your avatar, and reporting posts that exist just to attack and antagonize other users.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And, of course, there are some real jerks on Videoverse, as there usually are in such spaces–people who spout sexist crap or other repugnant nonsense. As Emmett, I took some satisfaction in reporting them and trying to keep Videoverse safe and welcoming for everyone. Doing stuff like this does net you some neat little in-game rewards, like new options for customizing your Videoverse avatar and new color themes for the message boards, but I was mostly motivated by the fact that Videoverse felt real to me and I just wanted it to be a place where people would want to spend time. I don’t know how deep this goes, but I definitely got the sense that how you choose to moderate the boards and how you treat others can have an impact on how Videoverse evolves over the course of the story.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2afdb5ad292a912fce1b6bca4e4c1f21\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2afdb5ad292a912fce1b6bca4e4c1f21\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1739\" data-height=\"978\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'A user named GlitterGirl asks for help in a game.

Is he just yanking everybody’s chain, or does he really have the inside scoop? Without spoiling anything, I’ll say that trying to figure out his whole deal was very enjoyable, and the results elegantly served as another thread in <em>Videoverse</em>’s thematic concerns with the passage of time and with what we sometimes lose as companies “improve” their products and make things obsolete.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h75981\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>All yesterday’s parties</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Supporting all this emotional and thematic texture are the game’s engaging visuals. Naturally, as a game set on an early 2000s message board, <em>Videoverse </em>is hardly pushing state-of-the-art graphics, but what it does have is beautiful, authentic-feeling visual design. The aforementioned ads and fan art you see around the boards are bursting with personality, and each artist posting to the boards has their own art style, just as each person has their own distinct voice. Additionally, Emmett and his friends have a nifty accessory for the console called a Shark Cam, which often lets us see their faces as they text-chat. Kinmoku once again displays the same knack for expressive artwork that they showed off in <em>One Night Stand</em>, and seeing Emmett break into laughter or furrow his brow in concern as he chats with Vivi or other friends lends the text exchanges more emotional life.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Everything ends. But we take something from the times and places we’ve left behind and carry it with us as we move forward in life. I know that the countless hours I spent on forums in the early 2000s weren’t time wasted but a crucial part of my development as a person. I probably wouldn’t be here right now if it hadn’t been for those experiences. <em>Videoverse </em>is a beautiful exploration of how the online spaces we inhabit and the connections we form in them can shape our lives as much as anything.</p>', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', 'This New Game Is A Great Tribute To Early Online Gaming Communities', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/bc841dc14ac194a1e5756d38ac6919ed.jpg', 'pc', 'https://kotaku.com/videoverse-game-review-online-gaming-forums-vn-kinmoku-1850780173', 'Many people who grew up with the internet had formative experiences in communiti...', NULL);

You control a lone commander on horseback and set about building up a small kingdom while fending off waves of increasingly difficult enemies. It starts out simply enough, but new enemy types and increasingly complex maps add new hurdles for you to overcome. So far I’ve finished the tutorial and first two maps, and am absolutely in love with it. </p>\n\n\n<section class=\"sc-q35npn-0 eNnFZk\">\n</section>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are only three factors to manage—gold, upgrades, and soldiers. During the day you visit nodes on the map to choose what to spend your gold on building. New houses and farms will earn more gold, while walls, watchtowers, and barracks will improve your defenses. It seem simple at first, but the streamlined economics offer just enough interesting trade-offs to make you think without turning every round into a mini deathmarch of planning and number crunching.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b1fbbdfe71416a88d956a4c3446b6501\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b1fbbdfe71416a88d956a4c3446b6501\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows different maps. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b1fbbdfe71416a88d956a4c3446b6501\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b1fbbdfe71416a88d956a4c3446b6501\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows different maps. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For example, you’ll want to spend most of your gold on buildings that generate revenue early on so you can start compounding your earnings. Leave yourself too defenseless, however, and you’ll get easily overrun. Barracks and archery ranges, meanwhile, let you choose which types of units to recruit. Knights are armored but slow, while pikemen are faster and have higher damage. Crossbow units are strong but short range, while ones with long bows can hit enemies that are farther away. Once you select which route to go, you’re locked in, making it important to plan for the future without getting bogged down in tons of possibilities.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At night, you face off against mobs made up of all different unit types coming from multiple directions. Your armies will target whatever’s closest or you can marshall them around in small groups by walking up to them, clicking, and then having them follow you somewhere else. Your commander will also attack, take damage, and buff nearby units if certain upgrades are unlocked. That’s the extent of your moment-to-moment impact during fights, and it provides a nice balance between the micro-management of a full-blown real time strategy game and the completely hands-off approach of some city builders.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The nicest thing about<em> Thronefall </em>is its upkeep. Units are slowly replenished for free as they die, and buildings that are destroyed automatically get resurrected at full health the next day. The only penalty is that they won’t generate more money for you if they were destroyed the round prior. Otherwise there’s no real negative consequence for getting completely steamrolled as long as you keep your central castle intact. In addition to cutting out a ton of tedium, it also reduces the anxiety and frustration associated with wasting resources. <em>Thronefall </em>focuses more on rewarding you for making smart decisions rather than punishing you for the bad ones. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"3fa7c04d659aa86905191bcd8890f775\" data-recommend-id=\"image://3fa7c04d659aa86905191bcd8890f775\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows collecting money in the game. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"3fa7c04d659aa86905191bcd8890f775\" data-recommend-id=\"image://3fa7c04d659aa86905191bcd8890f775\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows collecting money in the game. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“Getting older and caught in the usual swamp of work and responsibilities, we realized we don’t have the 100 hours to sink into the next super-complex game anymore,” Grizzly Games’ Paul Schnepf told <em>Game Developer</em> <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/mastering-minimalism-and-layering-complexity-with-strategy-game-thronefall\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/mastering-minimalism-and-layering-complexity-with-strategy-game-thronefall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in an interview</a></span>. “We felt there was a need for wholesome and deep, but also less time-consuming, experiences.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve enjoyed how breezy the game is, but I can definitely see the difficulty and complexity ramping up a bit further in.

Despite the years of waiting, it feels like a rough first draft that needs more work. Set in a kingdom thrust into civil war over a succession crisis and royal family in-fighting, it follows two romantically involved soldiers, Vashti and Desmond, onto the battlefield as their conflicting loyalties and principles threaten to unravel their lives. Every scene is rendered with beautiful sprites reminiscent of Square Enix’s classic, and each new plot point is punctuated by a turn-based fight on a chessboard-like grid between competing squads of archers, medics, magicians and knights.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"5704418bd103d18e7eeec561c5a3241a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5704418bd103d18e7eeec561c5a3241a\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows combat in Arcadia Atlas. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"5704418bd103d18e7eeec561c5a3241a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5704418bd103d18e7eeec561c5a3241a\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A GIF shows combat in Arcadia Atlas. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve played about four hours so far, and the story can be compelling when it doesn’t feel barebones or clumsy. Star-crossed lovers thrust into the chaos of a civil war is a fine crucible for interrogating what makes characters tick and how far they’re willing to go to fight for what matters most to them, even if the dialogue sometimes feels undercooked, “Listen, I’m not happy about it either, but you know how much dark magic damaged my village,” Desmond tells Vashti early on. “As much as I hate to say it, he has to be put to death.”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But the real issue with <em>Arcadian Atlas </em>is that it’s a chore to navigate and play, and there’s no real creativity or depth in its RPG systems to make battles exciting or make it satisfying to grow and level up your crew. Skill trees are brief and mostly revolve around earning damage upgrades. There are a dozen unique job classes, but you can’t mix and match abilities. Combat also heavily favors ranged units, which have good damage output and little risk of ever missing their target.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2353550b74c45139a07e872fd530c42b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2353550b74c45139a07e872fd530c42b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2880\" data-height=\"1620\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows the roster menu. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2353550b74c45139a07e872fd530c42b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2353550b74c45139a07e872fd530c42b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2880\" data-height=\"1620\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows the roster menu. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The battlefield also feels wonky and incomplete. Animations for unit movement and attacks don’t feel fluid, and terrain has no real impact on strategy. Fireballs and arrows can pass through obstacles and comrades unimpeded, while melee units can strike anyone next to them no matter how much higher or lower the adjacent squares are. It makes for very unbalanced encounters with little in the way of tactical trade-offs to consider or competing priorities to weigh.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In isolation, none of these shortcomings would be that big of an issue, but taken together they slowly add up to a simplistic and tedious experience that’s hard to recommend to even the genre’s biggest fans. Eventually even the mildest frustrations become hard to ignore, like having to press the accept button to progress every finished loading screen, and the fact that navigating the battlefield grid requires repeatedly flicking the thumbstick on the gamepad rather than simply holding it. The game supports mouse and keyboard as well, but I actually found the cursor controls to be even more finicky and sticky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">One of the few points of pleasure for me in each battle was the soundtrack. Instead of dramatic horns and violins, <em>Arcadian Atlas</em>’ jazz-infused soundtrack by composer Moritz P.G. Katz is dominated by saxophones and guitars. The standard combat music in particular is so oddly unexpected but catchy, I still found it playing inside my head days later. I wish I could say the rest of my time with the game felt as memorable. </p>', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', 'I Wish I Loved This Final Fantasy Tactics-Inspired SRPG 7 Years In The Making', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/388e1e2ace696e1b8999b0d39c53843e.jpg', 'pc', 'https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-arcadian-atlas-srpg-steam-review-1850692803', 'Final Fantasy Tactics nailed so many things so exquisitely that, despite plenty ...', NULL);

With a million copies sold in its first month, this indie title from Korean developers Mintrocket crosses diving and fishing with running a restaurant, and creates one of the best games we’ve seen in 2023. Here’s why.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Right now, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/livestreams/welcome.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/livestreams/welcome.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is in the midst of one of its annual explorations of the sea floor</a></span>. Live-streamed on YouTube, an unmanned submersible drops down a couple of miles to the seabed, and films transects of the unexplored regions, as informed and excited scientists explain everything we’re seeing. Sometimes, if you’re very lucky, you’ll see them discovering a brand new species of peculiar deep-sea life, at which point (if they see enough of them to be sure it’s not the last of its kind) it’s very likely you’ll watch a remote-operated vacuum sloooooop up the little creature, for them to study up top. I am entirely unaware if they ever eat them.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I tell you all this because it’s with these fascinating explorations playing on my second monitor that I’ve been playing the absolutely wonderful <em>Dave The Diver</em>, in which I am making my own underwater explorations, attempting to gather new species of fish, in order to…serve them up in a sushi restaurant Dave is co-running with an odd chap called Cobra, and a wunder-chef called Bancho. It’s a very similar endeavor, just with slightly differing goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Think of <em>Dave The Diver</em> as the aquatic version of <em>Moonlighter</em>, Digital Sun’s charming action-RPG in which you delve into dungeons by night, collecting loot that you then sell at your shop the next day. Forgoing that game’s fantasy trappings, <em>Dave </em>is a pixel-based RPG in which you alternate between diving into a mysterious, ever-changing bay to catch as many fish as you can, and then helping run a bustling sushi restaurant that serves up your catches based on a menu you put together each evening, with a growing staff you (somewhat) manage, and a social media-savvy customer base to impress. You make money in your business to buy new equipment and increase (decrease?) the depths to which you can dive, the oxygen supply you can take with you, and the quality of your harpoon to catch bigger and more dangerous fish.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And if that were the whole game—diving for new catches, running the restaurant to make profit, buying new equipment to explore further—it would be a winner. I’d be fulsomely recommending it to you right now, because it would be a feedback loop of enormous satisfaction and fun. But that’s not the whole game, not even a bit. <em>Dave The Diver</em> is a game that will not stop getting bigger, more interesting, and perhaps most importantly, more outright bonkers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0059a0ff57bdc67d2d552ec5641e5644\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0059a0ff57bdc67d2d552ec5641e5644\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1432\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Opening the sushi restaurant for the evening\'s service.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0059a0ff57bdc67d2d552ec5641e5644\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0059a0ff57bdc67d2d552ec5641e5644\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1432\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Opening the sushi restaurant for the evening\'s service.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Introducing new features like other games introduce loading screens, <em>DTD </em>evolves continuously. At first, you’ll be focused on getting your sushi place up-and-running, serving a handful of dishes to a scant few customers a night. During your two daily dives, you’ll catch the fish you need to create new recipes and dishes, along with finding various shells, starfish, and other novelties. Oh, and weapons. Guns. Lots of underwater guns, that can’t survive the transition above the waves. But the more you play, the more characters you encounter, who want to get involved.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There’s Duff, for instance, who will build you new, permanent guns, based on the designs of those you find, and with materials you pick up on your dives. Or there’s Ellie, who wants you to do some ecological work for spurious reasons, gathering all manner of non-fish life. And, er, Dr. Bacon, who wants your help investigating signs of a mythical underwater “sea people,” exploring ancient caves and deciphering strange runic texts.

Brilliantly so. Even after many, many hours, the game is still chucking entirely new elements at me thick and fast. There comes a point where you’ll be certain you’ve got the bulk of the game by now, especially with its later addition of night fishing, when it suddenly introduces an entire fish farm, complete with breeding program, and a storyline for its host, Otto, about a long-lost missing son. There are other, far more ridiculous story elements that I’m not sharing because they’re much more fun to discover for yourself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Importantly, the two core elements work very well. The fishing, which is how you’ll spend most of your time when playing, is about swimming the portly Dave ever-deeper into this inexplicable bay that changes its geology every time you explore. Along the way, you’ll harpoon all manner of fish, using all manner of strange harpoons (electric, say, or most confusingly, flammable), and an ever-growing arsenal of guns, used to weaken the large, stronger fish before you try to catch them. Many fish are predatory, and will attempt to munch on Dave, including some sizeable and furious sharks. Dave’s health is entirely represented by the amount of oxygen he has remaining, with attacks knocking off huge chunks. O2 is frequently replenished via underwater sources, but running out means a brush with death, and a rescue that only allows you to retrieve a single object you’ve picked up or fished on that dive.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The better your equipment, the further and deeper you’re able to explore, which opens up new arrays of fish to catch, and often more dangerous fish to battle. At the same time, a dive might have you facing off against a gang of underwater pirates, or some other surprise twist. On some occasions you’ll want to do a straight fishing trip, building up stocks for the restaurant, and avoiding the greater dangers. On others, you might try to reach a new depth, or complete a specific quest, without gathering too much you wouldn’t want to lose should you fail.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"4d772eafd5fa8b787cd6b24eb350a89e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://4d772eafd5fa8b787cd6b24eb350a89e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1867\" data-height=\"1050\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Duff works on one of his weapon creations.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"4d772eafd5fa8b787cd6b24eb350a89e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://4d772eafd5fa8b787cd6b24eb350a89e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1867\" data-height=\"1050\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Duff works on one of his weapon creations.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Then there’s the sushi place. Your job is theoretically “manager,” but in reality it’s “dogsbody.” Poor Dave. At first you need to do <em>everything</em> except for the cooking. That means pouring green tea, bussing tables, and clearing up empty dishes, all without customers getting upset at tardiness. Dave is not a thin chap, and like the mighty penguin, while superb underwater, isn’t the best on land. So you’ll soon be able to hire staff, even train them, to keep up with the growing popularity of the business.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Here too there are surprise twists, absolutely daft customers coming in with specific requests, for whom you will need to catch specific fish to meet their whims. So many elements of the restaurant are accompanied by <em>hilarious</em> mini-cutscenes, animated montages of new recipes being discovered, or customers’ experience of ecstatic pleasure at tasting their required dish.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And yet as much as I describe, <em>Dave The Diver</em> is doing so much more! It’s never overwhelming, thankfully, with the bustle of an evening’s service the most frantic element at play. The rest allows you to play things out at your own pace, a dive lasting as long as you can make it, without nagging you to get back. You can expect dives to last a solid 20 minutes each by the time you’re a few hours in, always with something new to do, somewhere new to reach, or some madcap quest to complete.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Then within this, every element is delivered with such glee. Its relatively simple opening belies an intricate game that’s more RPG than anything else, each aspect delightfully detailed and refined. If there’s any weakness, it’s that occasionally the Korean game’s English could be <em>slightly</em> tighter, but even this feels ridiculously nit-picky.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"d74dd32fb815f4d3ec6651b5f10f2ac9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d74dd32fb815f4d3ec6651b5f10f2ac9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1432\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Social media in Dave the Diver.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"d74dd32fb815f4d3ec6651b5f10f2ac9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d74dd32fb815f4d3ec6651b5f10f2ac9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1432\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Social media in Dave the Diver.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Dave The Diver</em> very much deserves the enormous success it’s received in its first month, selling over a million copies, and hopefully making developers Mintrocket enormously rich.

Mita, the blue-haired, diamond-eyed protagonist of the mobile game I play, requests I put her dirty clothes away, cook her chicken soup, and earn money through mini-games over a series of fast-track days.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"55c14e26a72660dee84c47ffe9a4d502\" data-recommend-id=\"image://55c14e26a72660dee84c47ffe9a4d502\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3780\" data-height=\"2124\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The anime protagonist of MiSide closes her eyes against a pink background.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"55c14e26a72660dee84c47ffe9a4d502\" data-recommend-id=\"image://55c14e26a72660dee84c47ffe9a4d502\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3780\" data-height=\"2124\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The anime protagonist of MiSide closes her eyes against a pink background.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The point-and-click intro is a bit clunky, like when it cuts to a “Day 5” title card before I get the chance to make any soup, but its design and art style is lipstick-smooth and cohesive. I appreciate the attention to detail, like Mita’s satisfaction meter in the top-left corner, and her funny imploring to “Remember! You can play [mini-games] to get money.” It makes me feel like I’m about to play a knowing parody of the stalker woman trope, a <em>Fatal Attraction</em> spurred by G-Fuel, but then it starts falling apart.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Mita tells me to put my phone down, and when I do, I’ve seemingly been transported into her game, finding myself inside a 3D, explorable version of the house depicted in the 2D introduction. I walk through it in first-person to observe more amusing details—a book on the shelf titled “How to Tease Him,” a small doll with red eyes that follow me around Mita’s peach-pink room—that, again, demonstrate pleasant artistic sensibility. I like the soundtrack, too; it’s a sorrowful new-age synth loop that detunes whenever something extra scary happens, like when the electricity suddenly gives out.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s also around this point that the game’s logic starts breaking down. After Mita appears in the anime-style flesh, dialogue prompts to learn more about how I entered her game and why only make me more confused. Asking outright about what happened triggers a black screen while Mita presumably explains, and when the game cuts back to her she declares “And here you are!” like I have any idea of what she said. Other dialogue that should give me goosebumps ends up being similarly frustrating, like when I ask her why she requested I hand her a pair of scissors during dinner.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“I can also open the sauce with a knife, of course,” Mita says, “But I wanted to have everything ready for your return, so you can’t see the long preparations. I love making surprises! Yeeep.” Well, no one promised me she would be the most coherent virtual girlfriend.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The demo ends shortly after this. While we’re playing a card game, my protagonist hears a thumping sound coming from Mita’s closet. Mita stops him from prying it open, citing her private underwear stash, then addresses his anxiety with something that makes me sad: “This world…it’s just these four rooms. Wouldn’t that be enough for you? Will you just try to stay with me?”<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When it’s time for me to reply, “stay” is, confoundingly, a locked dialogue option. The game seems to resist thinking too hard about the implications of its own story—how lonely a girl must become if she’s stuck inside a phone, always needing more but never able to get it on her own terms—and instead hopes that players think a devoted woman is scary enough by herself.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even still, <em>MiSide</em> doesn’t brush its isolated woman with either <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://jezebel.com/single-white-female-or-unmarried-karen-1844792703\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://jezebel.com/single-white-female-or-unmarried-karen-1844792703\"><em>Single White Female</em>’s pity</a></span> or <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/22/heathers-mean-girls-hairspray\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/22/heathers-mean-girls-hairspray\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Heathers</em>’</a></span> acid empathy in its demo.

You are driving little robot vehicles around the surface of Mars, doing jobs for people, and those jobs involve you having to build your own cars (or whatever else!) <!-- -->in a way that gets the job done.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Let’s say you get a contract where you need to take a steel beam from one little Martian base to another. You open up a lovely little building screen—one that is <em>very </em>reminiscent of LEGO instruction manuals—and, from a limited selection of parts, get building. You’ll need something to hold the steel, that ideally can also carry it across the surface of Mars, and you’ll also need something to reposition the steel when you get there for delivery.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So you do that—or at least something you <em>think </em>will do that—and get driving. And within 20 seconds, you know you have messed <!-- -->it up. This little car isn’t going to be hauling anything anywhere, it’s a disaster, your wheels are spinning all over the place, the steel has fallen out and not for the first time in this game you will be back to, and spending a lot of time at, the drawing board. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Mars First Logistics</em> is, at its heart, a physics puzzler. If you’ve ever blown up a rocket on the launchpad in <em>Kerbal Space Program</em> or driven a misshapen buggy off a cliff in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, you’ll be right at home here. It’s not the challenge itself you’re really out to master, but the way that challenge is represented in a world that has a ruthless awareness of its own gravity:</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All that jiggling around and broken cars and repeated failures could have been a recipe for frustration, but as the video above shows, <em>Mars First Logistics</em> is anything but. Thanks to a combination of its floaty gravity, cheery visuals and—I cannot quantify this, so just trust me—<em>cute </em>handling, to play it for stretches of time is to be at the helm of an adorable little blooper reel, each stuck payload or spinning set of tyres eliciting more of a “haha, we’ll get ‘em next time” than a “fuck this, I hate it”. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Please note I don’t want to somehow demean or dismiss<em> Mars First Logistics’</em> puzzling credentials by focusing solely on the fact it’s funny (even though, compared to gaming’s own deeply unfunny norms, this is a comedic masterpiece). It’s funny <em>because </em>it’s so hard, and that humour does a fantastic job of defusing the trial-and-error that could so easily have frustrated in a game like this. Even <em>Tears of the Kingdom’s</em> toughest nuts are child’s play compared to some of the challenges here, which don’t just ask a lot of you in terms of carrying them out—delicately balancing an ever-toppling payload as you drive it over bumpy hills—but in preparing for them in the first place.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">See, <em>Mars First Logistics</em> isn’t an immediately open sandbox game, it makes you earn it. You don’t start it with every tool at your fingertips, each part available in limitless quantities. You get money for completing courier jobs, and you can then spend that money unlocking more parts. So there’s an economy at play, allowing you to focus on the type of vehicles you want to build, and how fancy you want to make them. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0a64169dbc425c4ad3b8e07f280cf080\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0a64169dbc425c4ad3b8e07f280cf080\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0a64169dbc425c4ad3b8e07f280cf080\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0a64169dbc425c4ad3b8e07f280cf080\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I found myself spending most of my time not on the game’s open world but in its LEGO-like building screen, endlessly tinkering with wheels and control arms and servos  that can be arrayed however you like them, or at least however you think they’ll be able to get a job done.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s fun to mess around with, and can allow for creations of immense precision, but I think the real joy of <em>Mars First Logistics</em> is that it doesn’t need you to be perfect. You can shoot for it, sure, but at the end of the day you’re here to do a job, and so long as you get it done, the game is happy.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Take the steel beam job I mentioned above. I <em>could </em>have spent an age agonising over the most economical and functional vehicle possible, which is something the game definitely allows for and a path which some players might feel compelled to force themselves down. What I ended up doing after a few hilariously inept failures, though, was creating a buggy that could just drag the beam precariously across the countryside, which worked so long as I drove <em>really </em>carefully.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A good video game would have forced me to make the economical and functional one. A very good one would let me make whatever the hell I want.

Maybe you’re preternaturally attractive, or perhaps incredibly book smart. You could get yourself the extra perception of a keen eye, or...the ability to talk to animals. Each dramatically affects how you experience the story to come. And from the start, you begin deciding how you want to interact at any given moment, allowing you to be told its creepy tale of woodland horrors and impending doom defined by the relationships you form, the places you visit, and the people you betray.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve played so many games over the years that have promised the above, and so very few have delivered. But <em>Scarlet Hollow</em> is an exemplar, a game that truly understands that the trick is not to try to write an infinite number of story paths but rather to allow the player to experience its core story path in a unique way. And Chapter 4 goes <em>so</em> much further with this, not only carrying over all your decisions and relationships from the previous three episodes but based on those, allowing you to make enormously important decisions about how things will progress.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"bba05d8eb06134de770355b1d87d7c5c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bba05d8eb06134de770355b1d87d7c5c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2510\" data-height=\"1413\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Having your tea leaves read.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"bba05d8eb06134de770355b1d87d7c5c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bba05d8eb06134de770355b1d87d7c5c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2510\" data-height=\"1413\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Having your tea leaves read.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You’ll note I’m being deliberately ambiguous here because reviewing a game halfway through its planned seven chapters is not an easy task. Literally everything is a spoiler at this point, not only in the sense of opening a book midway through and starting to read, but even acknowledging the characters who are still around. People have lived and died based on my actions.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Instead, I’ll talk more broadly. In this latest and largest chapter, with many friendships formed or lost, and the core elements of the story already laid out, it’s able to let stuff really get rolling. Chapter 4 is where the game leans much harder into its horror, yet is the first time you’ll be able to engage in any of the five possible romance options. Which is a pleasing contrast.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While you’ve only been in town for four days, a <em>lot</em> has happened to you and your group of friends. An <em>awful</em> lot if you made one particular, game-changing decision at the end of Chapter 3. So being able to tell the character of your choice that you’re into them doesn’t feel rushed or forced—and indeed, you’re perfectly welcome not to say any such thing to anyone. The horror, meanwhile, is also surprisingly variable, given how you choose to approach things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> I’m loath to deliberately see multiple paths, preferring to just play through for the sake of preserving my own experience, but for the sake of reviewing, I obviously had to check out if other options really were as divergent as they appeared, or if they were bluffs that would steer back to the same course. They weren’t bluffs. One side path I took with a safe save beforehand saw the most incredibly grisly events take place, and I can’t even imagine where the story would go following them. Replaying the whole chapter, but changing how I ended Chapter 3, saw even more changes. It’s ultimately the same game, the same scenes in a similar order, but it’s how you perceive them that so dramatically alters. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"dce707e20e24b93e40f03e21449bb3df\" data-recommend-id=\"image://dce707e20e24b93e40f03e21449bb3df\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2506\" data-height=\"1413\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The local police aren\'t exactly helpful.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"dce707e20e24b93e40f03e21449bb3df\" data-recommend-id=\"image://dce707e20e24b93e40f03e21449bb3df\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2506\" data-height=\"1413\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The local police aren\'t exactly helpful.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For a game that’s played by making narrative choices, Chapter 4 achieves something incredible: a sense of urgent, panicked danger. Despite being able to click through the dialogues at my own pace, I found myself frantically speeding up at points, chased as I was, desperately looking for a route to safety! In other places, depending on how you ended the previous chapter, the game limits your choices, reversing this feeling and making me wish I could somehow slow things down to not miss out on any element.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m so obsessed with how intricately <em>Scarlet Hollow</em> crafts its narrative that I could forget to talk about its art. But this continues to be stunning, every scene hand-drawn, and while it doesn’t boast the remarkable animated dream art of Chapter 3, it’s far more detailed, displaying stunning drawings for scenes barely glimpsed at once as you play. That the small team behind this project is able to get more ambitious with every chapter is incredible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I feel like <em>Scarlet Hollow</em> is a demonstration of how the format for the visual novel is just a foundation on which so much greater can be built. While the screenshots may look like a standard VN, the game itself is vastly more, not just with its RPG-like systems and ridiculously complex balancing of choices, but the far greater sense of scale, time, and significance. I’ve been blown away by it all over again.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can get <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>’s first four chapters <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">from Steam right now</a></span>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">  <em>This article originally appeared on </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://buried-treasure.org/2022/12/scarlet-hollow-episode-4/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://buried-treasure.org/2022/12/scarlet-hollow-episode-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buried Treasure</a></span>. <em>You can </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.patreon.com/buriedtreasure\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.patreon.com/buriedtreasure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>support the Patreon here</em></a></span><em>.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> <br></p>', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', '2024-01-10 16:47:01', 'The Best Narrative Game Of The Last Two Years Just Got Even Better', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/24dc462032cc311d27017dc7c7140d24.jpg', 'pc', 'https://kotaku.com/steam-pc-visual-novel-scarlet-hollow-black-tabby-games-1849868619', 'I am so beyond delighted to report that Scarlet Hollow, one of my favorite games...', NULL);

This is a <em>Hexen-</em>like<!-- --> FPS, with enormous, sprawling maps, a whole bunch of <!-- --> weapons, an array of enemy types, and some fresh ideas original to the genre.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In three chapters, like all such games should be, the game’s 21 maps are spread between these via three hubs. Each hub has a collection of portals, unlocked by completing tasks in one or another, and dashing between them all as you find keys, new abilities, and so on. It gives it a little flavour of <em>Metroid</em> in amongst the fast-paced frenetic combat and exploration.</p>\n\n\n<section class=\"sc-q35npn-0 eNnFZk\">\n</section>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What I really love here is that <em>Hands Of Necromancy</em> doesn’t feel beholden to <em>Heretic</em> and <em>Hexen</em>, but rather inspired by them to then be its own thing. So as you would hope, there’s a mix of ranged and close-up combat, with a sword and fireball in your starting line-up, then ever-expanded upon as you progress. You find a whirlwind spell that lets you unleash mini tornados, that swoosh enemies backward, and if pinned against a wall, really takes the life out of them. There’s a freezy ice wand, a scythe of rather impressive power, and even a gun when you get far enough in.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Enemies are an amazing mix, with creepy-crawlies, floaty magic-wielding wizards, flying bats (that <em>aren’t</em> impossibly annoying!), and stomping golems. By chapter 2 this same gang is joined by all manner of even more deadly beasties, until fights can be a crazed barrage of colour and gore.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"6654205653c413fef22ad19488b082b4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6654205653c413fef22ad19488b082b4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2556\" data-height=\"1406\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An array of enemies all attacking at once in Hands Of Necromancy.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"6654205653c413fef22ad19488b082b4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6654205653c413fef22ad19488b082b4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2556\" data-height=\"1406\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An array of enemies all attacking at once in Hands Of Necromancy.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s all in 2.5D, but with some very pretty lighting, the whole thing built in GZDoom. The pixel art on the creature designs is fantastic, and while the game leans too much toward gloomy environs, the locations feel detailed and interesting to explore. And more importantly, level design is top-notch, focused on large locations to explore, packed with underground chambers, maze-like crypts, and puzzle-filled towns.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Your character, himself an evil sorcerer, is no hero, out here looking to expand his range of abilities, and fighting not to survive, but because you just want to fight. This obviously doesn’t hugely impact the experience, until you’re reminded of it when picking up a powerful weapon and letting out a villainous cackle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Oh, and as you progress you gain the ability to turn into various enemy types, including the little snake, the punchy golem, and a horned devil-like beast. This can be used for puzzle solving and secret finding, but also just to fight in a different way. I don’t think I’ve ever seen an FPS give the character the ability to transform into the enemies, and it’s such a splendid idea.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"d44f856864158a3fd3f70d84d6d502bd\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d44f856864158a3fd3f70d84d6d502bd\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2420\" data-height=\"1368\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A crescent moon rises over a town in Hands Of Necromancy, as my golem fist punches.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"d44f856864158a3fd3f70d84d6d502bd\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d44f856864158a3fd3f70d84d6d502bd\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2420\" data-height=\"1368\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A crescent moon rises over a town in Hands Of Necromancy, as my golem fist punches.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game estimates a 7-hour play-time, which is completely bonkers.

I guess you could blitz through it much more quickly, but that would seem such a waste.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is tremendous stuff, a game that could absolutely have been released alongside Raven Software’s mid-90s fantas<!-- -->y shooters and held up.

The school invites you to be an exchange student, and Blueberry Academy is a Pokémon trainer’s dream facility, as it’s built around a terarium that emulates four different biomes. Students capture and study Pokémon in habitats analogous to their natural homes. It’s a decent enough framing for a reasonably sized open-world environment, while also bringing some familiar Pokémon back into the fray.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>The Hidden Treasure Of Area Zero:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-Scarlet-Violet-Expansion-Pass/dp/B0BXN2HHF1/ref=sr_1_2?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-dlc-review-terapagos-1851100679&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0BXN2HHF1\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckAmpU2byt3\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckAmpU2byt3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fpokemon-scarlet-and-violet-expansion-pass-the-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero---nintendo-switch%2F391649.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fpokemon-scarlet-and-violet-expansion-pass-the-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero---nintendo-switch%2F391649.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"45cd97e3583217c67ffc63b6bf558e10\" data-recommend-id=\"image://45cd97e3583217c67ffc63b6bf558e10\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Shep walks into the terarium. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"45cd97e3583217c67ffc63b6bf558e10\" data-recommend-id=\"image://45cd97e3583217c67ffc63b6bf558e10\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Shep walks into the terarium. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h12\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Back to school</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Blueberry Academy is practically a workshop for building teams, customizing your character, and rounding up Legendary Pokémon for competitive play. Every trainer showdown is a double battle based around a competitive strategy. Sure, you can over-level and beat most of them with a super-effective move, but <em>The Indigo Disk </em>takes a refreshingly larger view of what <em>Pokémon </em>battles can be, rather than the tutorial-level strategies you tend to find in the base game.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even after finishing the main story, I’m having a lot of fun diving into Blueberry Academy’s extracurricular activities beyond catching and battling. The school has plenty of engaging systems and additional storylines to follow, such as inviting coaches from <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s Paldea region to visit me at the school, customizing my character with new haircuts and Poké Ball throwing styles, and tracking down Legendary Pokémon in <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-blueberry-legendary-1851090227\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-blueberry-legendary-1851090227\">the most absurd version of the endgame Legendary Feast</a></span> in the series yet.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s a shame that getting to all those clever features and side stories is a bit of a hassle. Part of that is because navigating the terarium is just as broken and buggy as any other version of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>. What’s more, <em>The Indigo Disk </em>implements Blueberry Quests that become the basis of everything you do in the DLC. While they do expand in complexity, these are pretty much the equivalent of a live-service game’s dailies, where you do menial tasks to earn microscopic amounts of in-game currency.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"587ce596860c8152d4631e63dd8f6961\" data-recommend-id=\"image://587ce596860c8152d4631e63dd8f6961\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'Larry says \"Calling me all the way out to another region...

But it does mean I spent swaths of <em>The Indigo Disk </em>doing silly little chores like defeating 10 Pokémon with quick battles, traveling an arbitrary distance, or crafting a technical machine just to satisfy the app on my character’s phone to give me the school’s made-up money. (Note: all money is made up.) It feels like unnecessary padding rather than a rewarding grind. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Everything you do in Blueberry Academy, from the main quest to the character customization, is tied to doing banal tasks just to make your BP number go up. Every time I realize I don’t have enough BP, I run to the closest group of wild Pokémon and send my Raichu after them until the app beeps in my favor. Sure, it makes you engage with the world, but it’s never in a way that feels meaningful. <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>give you a lot of verbs to use in a shallow world, and this loop of grinding quests to get the smallest amount of BP is the most blatant it’s ever felt.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0999e84e7311aee3a997e8268f39bbec\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0999e84e7311aee3a997e8268f39bbec\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Terapagos smiles at something off-screen.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0999e84e7311aee3a997e8268f39bbec\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0999e84e7311aee3a997e8268f39bbec\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Terapagos smiles at something off-screen.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h13\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>From ambition to reality</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I can forgive the mindlessness of <em>The Indigo Disk</em>’s weird, grindy loop because there’s some really cool features hidden behind them, and the DLC does have a pretty great finale. It doesn’t come close to <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s mind-blowing Yoko Taro-ass ending, but it does wrap up some of the mysteries of the Paldea region with some flair and emotional weight. I was disappointed by <em>The Indigo Disk</em>’s centering of new characters instead of the base game’s cast, but, its use of key players like Kieran—who has turned into an unhinged, Joffrey <em>Game of Thrones</em>-like bully after the events of <em>The Teal Mask</em>—still hit.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m not thrilled <em>The Indigo Disk </em>doesn’t go especially deep into the lore that fans have been speculating over for the past year, such as how its mascot, the Legendary multi-colored turtle Terapagos, could have factored into the events of the original games’ ending. Still, it is at least nice to put a face to what makes the Paldea region special. In the end, you find out what the titular Hidden Treasure of Area Zero is, but there are still parts of Paldean lore that remain a mystery. Maybe it’s fine that fans can continue to theorycraft about some pillars of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s story, but I would have liked to have seen a finale that went as hard as the main game.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Pokémon Scarlet And Violet: The Indigo Disk\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"pok-mon-scarlet-and-violet-the-indigo-disk\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Now that I’ve seen credits and am still grinding through Blueberry Academy’s myriad attractions, I’m running into all the same issues I have been since <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>launched last year.

(Why do I have to pay for each Poké Ball throwing style to see what it looks like?)<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But I also see the flashes of <em>Pokémon</em>’s untapped potential that <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>have always showcased. The open world isn’t deep, but riding around it seamlessly with your friends is still a childhood dream made reality.

Wonder</em> doesn’t cure covid-19. Trust me on that. But, if you ignore that one flaw and focus on everything else—the gorgeous graphics, the immensely creative levels, the pitch-perfect music—it’s easy to see this is one of Nintendo’s best <em>Mario </em>games in years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Check Out <em>Super Mario Bros.

Wonder</em>, out now on Switch, is the latest entry in Nintendo’s historic <em>Mario </em>franchise, and the first traditional 2D sidescroller starring everyone’s favorite plumber in over a decade. <em>Wonder </em>is also the first new <em>Mario </em>game to launch after the immensely popular animated film starring Chris Pratt and Jack Black. And let’s not forget, It’s also the first <em>Mario </em>game to feature a new voice actor as the famous Italian hero. All of that adds up to a weird, higher-than-normal amount of pressure and eyeballs on what was already a very hyped, highly anticipated <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> game. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Put in a similar situation, I’d suspect other studios and developers might play it extremely safe, creating something solid but familiar. Thankfully, history has shown us over and over that Nintendo isn’t like most other game companies, and <em>Wonder </em>is a testament to that.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At first glance, you might assume <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> is just another 2D<em> Mario </em>platformer, starring the iconic character, all his friends, the evil Bowser, and a plethora of new levels to hop through while collecting coins. And yes, that’s still the basic formula at work here in <em>Wonder</em>. But Nintendo uses that simple and proven design as a foundation for something wacky and fresh.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82512\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Wild, wacky weeds</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is most evident in the new Wonder Flowers, power-ups hidden in most levels that, when activated, trigger wild changes that alter how Mario looks, moves, or interacts with the world. These changes aren’t simple, either, like making Mario run a bit faster or making levels simply change color. Instead, Wonder Flowers dramatically and playfully throw out all the Mario rules and traditions veteran players might expect.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Once you trigger a flower, pipes may start to slink around like snakes, the world might become filled with water, Mario might turn into a super tall monstrosity or the entire level might stop and prompt you to answer some trivia questions.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f864e0f4f607beb14a05f6a1f1a83633\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f864e0f4f607beb14a05f6a1f1a83633\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows a silhouetted and very tall Mario jumping over a Goomba. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f864e0f4f607beb14a05f6a1f1a83633\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f864e0f4f607beb14a05f6a1f1a83633\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows a silhouetted and very tall Mario jumping over a Goomba. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some of my favorite effects completely changed how I played the game, with one flower altering the perspective of the stage, turning <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> into a top-down action game instead of a 2D platformer. Another time, a flower turned me into a Goomba—unable to jump or move fast—and filled the level with enemies who wanted to eat me. This meant I had to time out my moves and use mushrooms to hide and...oh wait a minute, would you look at that! I’m playing a stealth game starring Mario.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">None of these Wonder Flower experiences stick around too long, ending after a few minutes at most, and you can ignore the flower and complete the level normally if you so desire. But each time I started up a course in <em>Wonder</em>, I was excited to see the next creative twist on Mario. It reminded me of when I first played <em>Super Mario 64</em> as a kid and didn’t know much about the series or what to expect. Each new enemy and new world threw me for a loop. And <em>Wonder </em>recreates that feeling of well…wonder that has been missing in so many 2D <em>Mario </em>games for so long.</p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Super Mario Bros. Wonder\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"super-mario-bros-wonder\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s not just the Wonder Flowers that add to this sense of wonder, but Nintendo’s decision to stuff the game with mostly new enemies and power-ups. (Though some classics like the Fire Flower and Koopas do make a return, too.)<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’d often encounter some odd new enemy, like a walking firework shooter, and have to take a moment to figure it out. And once I had grokked it, I’d run into a new power-up—like the famous Elephant Fruit—and would then learn a new way to interact with or use it. Other power-ups like the Drill Helmet and Bubble Flower change how you explore levels or take out enemies. The result is that<em> Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> feels endlessly fresh, and is one of the most creative video games I’ve played in a long time.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82513\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>It’s fun, but is it hard?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Of course, all this wacky Wonder Flower stuff isn’t enough to make a <em>Mario </em>game good. The other big factor is how it actually feels to play, and <em>Wonder </em>nails this aspect perfectly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Running and jumping feel weighty, but not too heavy. Mario has a sense of momentum and heft, but he doesn’t feel like a lead weight holding the action back. Likewise, he doesn’t bounce around wildly like a bouncy ball covered in grease. I always felt like I had complete control of Mario, no matter how wild things got. So when I landed a cool move or pulled off a tricky jump, I felt like I did it. And when Mario died, it was always my fault and I knew what I did wrong and how to not screw it up next time.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Now, just how often you fail in<em> Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> is at the center of some online discourse. It seems like many folks are worried that Nintendo’s latest platformer isn’t a tough-as-nails experience. And the short answer is, yeah, it’s not very hard. If you’ve played past Mario games and platformers, odds are you’ll end <em>Wonder </em>with a surplus of extra lives and not too many deaths. Even I, someone who isn’t a platformer pro, ended <em>Wonder</em> with nearly 80 extra lives, and that’s without abusing any glitches or exploits. But I’m fine with this.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you want a super hard <em>Mario </em>game, the internet has spent years making ROM hacks and <em>Mario Maker</em> levels that will give you all the Kaizo action you could ever want. I also think that some complaints about <em>Wonder</em> being “too easy” come from folks who have played hundreds or thousands of official <em>Mario </em>levels, fan hacks, and other monstrosities, and these people are just never going to be challenged by anything from modern-day Nintendo. And that’s okay. I prefer Nintendo make creative and silly Mario games for the other 95% of players out there who just want to enjoy some Mario platforming without hair-pulling pixel-perfect precision platforming. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In other words, if you want a harder <em>Mario </em>game, there are plenty of options. However, I also acknowledge that <em>Wonder </em>could probably ramp up difficulty a tad without losing less-experienced players, especially in the first few worlds and courses, as some of those are almost mind-numbingly easy.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0edfa31f4762c23b91c2ca19cd2537d2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0edfa31f4762c23b91c2ca19cd2537d2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Mario running away from enemies on pink roller blades. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0edfa31f4762c23b91c2ca19cd2537d2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0edfa31f4762c23b91c2ca19cd2537d2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Mario running away from enemies on pink roller blades. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In Nintendo’s defense, <em>Wonder </em>does seem to try and placate both experts and newcomers with its badge system. Once equipped, the different badges you unlock throughout the campaign can let Mario jump higher, move faster, collect coins from defeating enemies, or even shoot a grappling hook.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some of the weirder badges in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> can make the game trickier to complete, like one that makes Mario hop all the time. Other badges have the opposite effect, adding blocks into levels to make them easier or giving Mario a Super Mushroom at every checkpoint or level start. It’s a system, like the Wonder Flowers, that seems designed to shake up the <em>Mario </em>formula but can also be ignored by players who prefer a pure platforming experience.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82514\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The best medicine</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I guess, before I wrap this up, I should mention the game’s “story.” The creativity and freshness found in the rest of the game doesn’t extend to the story of <em>Wonder</em>, which features Bowser stealing some magical power and becoming a big threat, and Mario running through seven worlds to collect the needed resources to stop the famous villain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s nothing too groundbreaking, though the final fight against Bowser is very good. But I don’t play Mario games for thrilling narratives or dramatic character arcs. I come back to these games because they—the best ones at least—make me smile, are endlessly inventive, and just feel good as heck to play.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0d910539cf0574592efbf8969a753bb1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0d910539cf0574592efbf8969a753bb1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Mario running on top of a moving pipe. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0d910539cf0574592efbf8969a753bb1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0d910539cf0574592efbf8969a753bb1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Mario running on top of a moving pipe. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I mentioned at the top that <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> didn’t cure my covid-19 infection, which is true, but I made that joke because if any video game could make someone feel physically better, this would be it.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Wonder</em> is a gorgeous, cartoonish jolt of creativity and silliness that makes me smile each time I play it. I genuinely felt better after a few hours of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>. It made me feel like a little kid again. Anything was possible in each of its courses, and by the end I had seen things I never expected to see in a Mario game. The feeling of playing <em>Wonder</em> didn’t cure my illness, but if I could bottle it and save it for a rainy day, I’d do it in a heartbeat. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Instead, I guess I’ll just play <em>Wonder</em> again the next time I need a pick-me-up. That’s easier and sounds like a lot more fun. <br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Check Out <em>Super Mario Bros.

Here, Pokémon live alongside humans as citizens rather than being kept in Poké Balls until they’re ready to battle. The city is both a tacit commentary on the competitive battling concept <em>Pokémon </em>was built on, and a perfect setting for an adventure game not beholden to turn-based conflict. The mysteries Tim Goodman and his talking, titular partner ‘mon solve in Ryme City are uniquely catered to the <em>Pokémon </em>universe without having to fall back on the same cultural touchstones as games like <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, where problems are resolved through battle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>Detective Pikachu Returns:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Detective-PikachuTM-Returns-Version-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C8YBXXSQ/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0C8YBXXSQ\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h9\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>A distinctly Pokémon mystery</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Because <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>commits to being a mystery game set in the <em>Pokémon </em>world, most of its puzzle-solving is made almost trivial by having a decent grasp of franchise lore and rules. Got a wall of ice blocking your path? Maybe check in with the fire-type Pokémon you saw on your way up. Need to follow a scent to track down evidence? A dog-like Pokémon can probably help you out. <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>doesn’t quite managed to deliver a complex mystery, but as someone who is mentally astral projecting into that universe at all times, it was a delight when my established <em>Pokémon </em>knowledge paid off, even when solutions felt incredibly obvious.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"d22a668f6064b3e6f504d9ac1a2a080c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d22a668f6064b3e6f504d9ac1a2a080c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Detective Pikachu hides while listening in on a suspect.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"d22a668f6064b3e6f504d9ac1a2a080c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://d22a668f6064b3e6f504d9ac1a2a080c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Detective Pikachu hides while listening in on a suspect.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sure, being a poké-pro accounts for some of that easy breeziness, but other times <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>just feels like an adventure game meant for young children. That isn’t inherently a bad thing, but it does mean certain aspects of gameplay are so simplistic that I question why they’re even present. QTE-driven action setpieces make a return, but they almost exclusively have you mashing A until your wrist cramps. And the collaborative nature of Tim and Pikachu’s detective work means you’ve always got someone talking you through each mystery, so there’s not much difficult deduction going on.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A lot of <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>’ mystery solving can feel pretty uneventful because most of the game is just talking to people. There’s not a lot of overt puzzle-solving or deduction, more just talking with Pikachu until you decide what Pokémon in the environment to point at a problem. The biggest gameplay addition here are case-specific companions that Pikachu can ride around an area to help solve mysteries. Growlithe can sniff around to track a scent, Luxray can see through walls, and Pangoro can use Strength to push boulders out of the way.

However, the story’s subject matter makes it one of the franchise’s darker entries, which feels markedly at odds with how kid-friendly it is as a video game.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <em>Detective Pikachu </em>subseries inherently questions everything we know to be good and righteous about the <em>Pokémon </em>world. After all, why would Ryme City—a place where Pokémon battles don’t happen and Pokémon don’t stay in Poké Balls—exist if everyone was on board with the franchise’s core battling conceit? But <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>takes things a step further by pretty overtly questioning the competence of law enforcement, and going as far as to outwardly criticize how the entire institution can become corrupt. It stops short of getting too radical, but <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>is surprisingly upfront with its depiction of how state-sanctioned power allows some of the most corrupt to ascend to power and keep it. All of this is explored in a distinct <em>Pokémon </em>framing and builds upon those themes in a way that makes Ryme City one of the most well-realized settings in the series.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h10\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Improving upon the movie’s weaknesses</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Beyond its commentary on institutional systems, <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>’ family narrative is maybe a bit inelegant in its dialogue, but the broad emotional strokes absolutely had me in their clutches. Unlike the live-action film, 2016’s original 3DS <em>Detective Pikachu</em> didn’t resolve its core mystery, which tasked Tim to find his missing father Harry with Pikachu by his side. The game’s take is a bit different from the movie’s, but it still has the same weight, and is the latest <em>Pokémon </em>game to strike a strong balance between weighty themes and dark twists while still being palatable to younger audiences. It doesn’t quite reach the buck-wild finale levels of <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>or <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s, but I’m happy to see The Pokémon Company really leaning into the possibilities of this world rather than shying away.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>Detective Pikachu Returns:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Detective-PikachuTM-Returns-Version-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C8YBXXSQ/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0C8YBXXSQ\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Detective Pikachu Returns\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"detective-pikachu-returns\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>’ late-game story swings elevate it beyond its mechanical simplicity, even if the live-action movie pretty much spoiled most of them in 2019. Part of the reason those reveals are still super effective is because the game pulls off a lot of those storylines in a more compelling fashion than the movie. The worst part of the live-action movie is how it pivots into being a disaster film in its final act and the explanations for its reveals feel underbaked. Whether by looking at the movie’s failings and iterating on them or because this is just what the team at Creatures had in mind from the beginning, <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>’ take on similar plot threads is just line-by-line better than the version we saw in theaters.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I say this as a person who loves the live-action movie. It’s one of my favorite things <em>Pokémon </em>has ever put out, even with its flimsy climax. Because that conclusion has been such a weird asterisk next to my recommendations of the film, seeing <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em> handle so many of the reveals with greater clarity in the writing, motivation, and world-building was almost healing. There’s a specific case near the end of the game entirely about why Pikachu can talk to Tim when other critters can’t, and the writing around it was so clever compared to the movie’s spin on the same storyline that my appreciation for the game skyrocketed in its home stretch.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"8329296eddf53ccecb80f46b334d194a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://8329296eddf53ccecb80f46b334d194a\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Detective Pikachu sits with Tim in front of a fire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"8329296eddf53ccecb80f46b334d194a\" data-recommend-id=\"image://8329296eddf53ccecb80f46b334d194a\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Detective Pikachu sits with Tim in front of a fire.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Somehow, the worst part of the <em>Detective Pikachu </em>movie is the best part of <em>Detective Pikachu Returns</em>. It feels like the conclusion I’ve been waiting for, even if getting there means going through a pretty unremarkable adventure game. But that was largely how I felt about the original 3DS <em>Detective Pikachu</em>. It was an incredibly simple mystery game meant to appeal to all ages, but in between the trivial puzzles and deduction, it delivered one of the best-ever depictions of the <em>Pokémon </em>world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>isn’t setting up a sequel, and while I’m glad to have some closure, I am sad to leave Ryme City. Sometimes I get tired of sending Pokémon out for battle to knock each other out, and I just want to go on adventures with Pikachu by my side. <em>Detective Pikachu Returns </em>is imperfect, but lets me revisit the <em>Pokémon </em>world I’d most like to live in. I hope, even if this is the end of Tim and Pikachu’s story, it’s not the end of The Pokémon Company doing interesting, off-the-wall adventure games that can look at this universe in fresh ways. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>Detective Pikachu Returns:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Detective-PikachuTM-Returns-Version-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C8YBXXSQ/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0C8YBXXSQ\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckJCiHna8Pp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdetective-pikachu-returns---nintendo-switch%2F396429.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">. </p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Detective Pikachu Returns: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/0f434c18a804b2501cff6925b387ffa3.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720', 'Detective Pikachu Returns, the new Switch adventure from Nintendo, is not great ...', NULL);

Either that, or their first DLC, <em>The Teal Mask</em>, is somehow worse at holding itself together than the base games were.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At a glance, I’m not sure why walking through Kitakami, the DLC’s tiny new region, threatened to break the game, but I experienced some of the worst framerate dips (sometimes even complete stoppage) I’ve ever experienced on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld. <em>The Teal Mask </em>runs so poorly that it leaves me once again bewildered that the original games launched in the state they did. Perhaps unsurprisingly, <em>The Teal Mask </em>feels like a microcosm of the base games’ larger issues, as well as their strengths.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Coming off <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s Yoko Taro-ass finale and going into <em>The Teal Mask</em>’s relatively low-stakes <em>Pokémon </em>story feels like a nice palate cleanser. We’re not dealing with life-and-death right now, with the DLC instead bringing things back to your character’s school life. You get dragged into an exchange program (all by yourself, too, so don’t expect to see Nemona, Penny, or Arven) with students from Blueberry Academy, a sister school to your Naranja Academy/Uva Academy (game version depending). You’re all to meet at the remote region of Kitakami and learn about the local culture and legends and partake in a festival to celebrate some of the Pokémon folklore. The story is where <em>The Teal Mask </em>shines in spite of the technical troubles, so perhaps fittingly, this DLC embodies both the best and worst parts of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Buy <em>The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-Scarlet-Violet-Expansion-Pass/dp/B0BXN2HHF1/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-dlc-review-ogerpon-1850839564&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0BXN2HHF1\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckAmpU2byt3\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckAmpU2byt3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> |<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fpokemon-scarlet-and-violet-expansion-pass-the-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero---nintendo-switch%2F391649.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fpokemon-scarlet-and-violet-expansion-pass-the-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero---nintendo-switch%2F391649.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ac2ef5465b9ce1f02712ea1aebc0dea6\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ac2ef5465b9ce1f02712ea1aebc0dea6\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kieran is shown holding a Pokeball in his hand before a battle.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ac2ef5465b9ce1f02712ea1aebc0dea6\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ac2ef5465b9ce1f02712ea1aebc0dea6\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kieran is shown holding a Pokeball in his hand before a battle.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>The Teal Mask</em> is at its best in its writing. New characters like the brother and sister duo Kieran and Carmine stand tall next to <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s already wonderful cast. Carmine is a hoot and a holler as she gives angry big sister energy and gradually softens overtime. Kieran, meanwhile, is the new expansion’s emotional core. Much of the DLC is about how kind-hearted people are excluded, and that extends both to the grander lore of Kitakami and its individual villages.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m really loving how much <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>delves into these really poignant stories, and even if <em>Teal Mask</em> never reaches the dramatic heights of the base games’ final hours, it feels reassuring to see Game Freak still writing <em>Pokémon </em>stories that build the world and its people out rather than feeling like vehicles to deliver more competitive tweaks and catchable critters. In that, <em>The Teal Mask </em>is already making a solid first impression for the wider expanded story the studio is adding through this collective <em>Hidden Treasure of Area Zero </em>expansion, which will be concluding in <em>The Indigo Disk</em> DLC set to launch later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Those themes extend to the story of Ogerpon, the enigmatic legendary Pokémon who is the headliner of the DLC and owner of the titular mask. The grass-type, mask-wearing little guy is part of local urban legends that, as you play through <em>The Teal Mask</em>, reveal themselves to be half-truths, and circle back into the story of disenfranchisement the DLC illustrates with Kieran. The tale is compelling, and even if it doesn’t dig too deep, its take on the cognitive dissonance the locals feel toward tradition in the face of new information is a pretty cool use of <em>Pokémon </em>lore. I’m not super compelled by Ogerpon as a Pokémon, and its original mechanic of being able to swap typings and other properties by wearing different masks doesn’t feel super novel after the <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> base games introduced modular typings with the Terastalize mechanic. Nonetheless, its story makes for an interesting cultural touchstone that helps fill out this new region.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"03e18ff42dcfd228f607d021ef7f43d4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://03e18ff42dcfd228f607d021ef7f43d4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Ogerpon is shown standing at the end of a flight of stairs.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"03e18ff42dcfd228f607d021ef7f43d4\" data-recommend-id=\"image://03e18ff42dcfd228f607d021ef7f43d4\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Ogerpon is shown standing at the end of a flight of stairs.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>The Teal Mask</em>’s low stakes feel like tablesetting for <em>The Indigo Disk</em>, which appears to be delving further into the hanging threads left by <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>. Even so, <em>Teal Mask</em> harbors darker undercurrents that leave me more looking forward to that DLC we don’t yet have. But <em>Teal Mask</em> and <em>Indigo Disk</em> have been marketed as a two-parter, so that’s not terribly surprising, and I did find a lot to love in the ground-level conflicts and relationships in this opening chapter. The final scene of the DLC, which I won’t spoil here, did at least hint that these smaller stories may soon escalate into something larger, and given how well <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s writing has handled stories of trauma, especially that felt by children, I’m really eager to see how Game Freak concludes this story in the next download.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But goddamn, getting to it is so rough. Walking through Kitakami’s open world is an absolute slog, with me and my Raichu trying to walk through pretty barren environments peppered with only a few civilians. I’m not sure why <em>The Teal Mask </em>gave me even worse performance issues than the main game, but whatever the reason, its framerate drops are even worse than <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s. The wild thing is, I know this is how <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> were. I’m keenly aware that despite my love of those games’ final hours, this was what I experienced for 25-30 hours as I made my way through Paldea to get to Area Zero.

(Don’t worry who you pick, they all play the same.) After selecting one of the classic Disney characters, what follows is a platforming adventure through a large, maze-like map spreading across multiple biomes that are filled with secrets, collectibles, and yes, Hidden Mickeys.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h35\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>No fighting, but lots of jumping!</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As the name implies, <em>Disney Illusion Island</em> is inspired by some of the most beloved old Mickey games, many of which had the word illusion in their titles. But unlike those games, which were traditional platformers with combat elements, <em>Illusion Island</em> ditches combat entirely and instead focuses on incredibly tight and fluid platforming. You won’t be jumping on top of enemies or picking up power-ups to shoot balls of fire or goo at baddies. While this might sound like an odd choice for a game that is Metroidvania-like in every other sense, it works wonderfully in <em>Illusion Island.</em><br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A big reason why the lack of combat never bothered me during my playthrough was because <em>Disney Illusion Island</em> never got dull. Every forty or so minutes I got a new ability that let me explore more of the map, or I took on some big platforming challenge or squared off against boss enemies—which don’t feature fighting, but instead rely on puzzles. One boss had me swing around specific points using my grapple ability. Eventually, after I dodged all the threats and activated every swing point, the enemy was knocked down and Mickey was able to use magic to turn them into stone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Disney Illusion Island </em>almost seems worried that you’ll get bored with it and stop playing, so it’s constantly trying to keep your attention, either through powers, collectibles, jokes, or silly characters. This mix of variety and approachability seems perfect for kids and adults alike.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Thankfully, the in-game map makes all of this content manageable. It’s easy to use and loads fast, letting you quickly see where you are and where you need to go. It also shows all the things you haven’t collected or paths you still need to unlock. Without this map,<em> Illusion Island</em> might feel like a chore to play. With it, the game is very hard to put down. I’d check it and think, “Well, I just need to go over there and I’ll get some more collectibles to unlock a health upgrade” and suddenly another 30 minutes had passed and I had not stopped playing. (This happened to me at least a few times.)<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h36\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>A platformer for everyone (who owns a Switch)</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What will also help kids (and adults with limited schedules) enjoy <em>Disney Illusion Island</em> is the way it gradually becomes more difficult, but never gets too hard. As long as I took my time or didn’t get distracted by the gorgeous art, I could avoid most baddies and traps. And when I did die, I never felt like the game had screwed me over thanks to its wonderfully snappy, responsive platforming controls and rock-solid performance when docked or played in handheld mode. Plus, deaths won’t cost you or your co-op partners much progress thanks to an ample amount of checkpoints throughout the world.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you crave platformers that aren’t brutal nightmares bent on making you throw your controller in frustration, you should play <em>Illusion Island</em>. And for those who do want a bit more challenge, you can tweak how much damage Mickey and friends can take before dying. If you lower this amount, you’ll add a bit more spice to Disney’s latest game.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"56803eaabcb781bd311c4b3cc235d469\" data-recommend-id=\"image://56803eaabcb781bd311c4b3cc235d469\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Minnie running across a platform near spikes. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"56803eaabcb781bd311c4b3cc235d469\" data-recommend-id=\"image://56803eaabcb781bd311c4b3cc235d469\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Minnie running across a platform near spikes. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">My only major complaint with <em>Disney Illusion Island</em> is its Nintendo Switch exclusivity.

He’s an amnesiac who’s made a deal with a death god named Shinigami who takes the form of a purple puffball ghost with a love of carnage and death, all while basking in it with lighthearted whimsy. Much like Kodaka’s previous work, the game uses the two characters’ contrasting views of the world to constantly oscillate between dire stakes and absurdist humor but uses its supernatural framing to crank the team’s usual antics up to an inevitable over-the-top conclusion. Much of <em>Rain Code </em>feels like Kodaka’s writing style at his most unhinged, no longer bound by the limitations of a (relatively) grounded setting and free to use magic, superpowers, and god-like entities to justify some wild imagery, for better or worse.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For the first few chapters, I was put off by <em>Rain Code</em>’s supernatural elements and how they framed the mystery-solving. As Yuma and Shinigami stumble into solving crimes around the city of Kanai Ward, Shinigami opens up a pocket dimension to a Mystery Labyrinth. These are pretty comparable to a Palace in <em>Persona 5</em> in that they are physical manifestations of the mystery itself. Every question there is about a case is given a literal form, whether that be doors to walk through to answer a multiple-choice question or an enemy that Yuma must fight with a truth-bearing blade to literally <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/danganronpa-captures-the-feeling-of-real-life-arguments-1821589146\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/danganronpa-captures-the-feeling-of-real-life-arguments-1821589146\">cut through their arguments</a></span> as they appear in text on the screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Danganronpa </em>represented these same concepts through mini-games that were more symbolic, such as imagining yourself snowboarding down a slope and choosing paths representing answers as you made deductions. <em>Rain Code </em>uses the Mystery Labyrinth to give everything a diegetic place in its world. I admire the commitment to the bit, but the framing initially felt like it was the game bending over backward to bring <em>Danganronpa</em> mechanics into a legally distinct format in a way that justified every moment of deduction and reasoning in a tangible way, rather than a conceptual one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It wasn’t until later chapters where <em>Rain Code </em>started to really reckon with the reality of using the Mystery Labyrinth that I started to buy in. Shinigami is a ghost when she and Yuma are in the real world, but once they enter the Labyrinth, she sheds her mascot character design for her true form: which is a tall, gothic woman who reaps upon the souls of the culprit at the end of each case. Once Yuma is confronted with the truth, he is also confronted with the cost of finding it. Unlike <em>Danganronpa</em>, this method and outcome aren’t forced on Yuma, he just continually falls on it as he’s put on his back foot. At its core, <em>Rain Code </em>is about the pursuit of the truth and its consequences, but while Shinigami leaves bodies in her wake, the game posits that the truth isn’t meant to be morally right or wrong. In exposing it, people can build from the truth rather than tear themselves down further.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Master Detective Archives: Rain Code\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"master-detective-archives-rain-code\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is why <em>Rain Code </em>constantly invites comparisons to Kodaka’s most prolific work. If it weren’t for all the clear mechanical and artistic parallels, that baseline belief in people is the symmetry that connects this team’s past and present work. <em>Rain Code</em>’s latter chapters invoke the same outburst of emotions that this team is best known for, even if it takes its time getting there. In many ways, its narrative and mysteries get messy, sometimes diluted by the supernatural framing rather than enhanced by it. But despite my initial misgivings, I was surprised at how well it came together. Given this team’s history, I probably should’ve trusted <em>Rain Code</em> to get me by the end.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All the framing aside, <em>Rain Code</em> does feel rough around the edges from a technical standpoint. Rather than using the 2D sprite-based visual novel style of <em>Danganronpa</em>, pretty much everything in <em>Rain Code </em>is rendered in 3D, and this game chugs something fierce on Switch. Whether it’s during the exploration segments through Kanai Ward or the action-oriented setpieces within the Mystery Labyrinth, the game often feels like it’s struggling to hold itself together. While third-person, 3D setup gives <em>Rain Code </em>its own flavor and allows the game some pretty spectacular visual moments (the neon-soaked cyberpunk aesthetic of Kanai Ward looks great when it’s not in motion), there were stretches of time where it felt like the game needed another pass for technical polish.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"23aa2484b76b8e3b6544f66b43019674\" data-recommend-id=\"image://23aa2484b76b8e3b6544f66b43019674\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Yuma is seen striking through a false claim in the Mystery Labyrinth.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"23aa2484b76b8e3b6544f66b43019674\" data-recommend-id=\"image://23aa2484b76b8e3b6544f66b43019674\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Yuma is seen striking through a false claim in the Mystery Labyrinth.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At a certain point, I think I became desensitized to the framerate drops and bought into the concept and was happy to dive into Mystery Labyrinth. Comparatively, <em>Rain Code</em>’s cases aren’t quite as elaborate as its predecessor’s, but they each had satisfying mysteries and an explosive human element at their core. Even when I would feel skeptical about a reveal, <em>Rain Code </em>would quickly point to a clue I’d long forgotten that tied things together. Some solutions might have felt farfetched, but within the world it established, these cases felt airtight and satisfying to solve, even when the conclusion was devastating to watch unfold.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Rain Code </em>is built by a team that knows how to make these kinds of games, and as a long-time fan of the themes Kodaka tends to write around, I was pretty moved by the end even though it nearly lost me in the beginning. If you’ve never been a fan of Kodaka’s mix of camp, heavyhanded themes, and theatrics, <em>Rain Code </em>will likely not grab you. But despite it feeling like <em>Danganronpa</em>’s distant cousin, it makes it clear this team doesn’t have to lean on Monokuma’s death game as a crutch and can build something new upon its bones instead. Hopefully, this means Kodaka can continue to let old things die on their own terms and make new things instead.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Review: The Makers Of Danganronpa Are Back With Another Mystery Banger', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/fd55437c2389edbd3a093839ded4fd5e.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843', 'I would rather not liken Master Detective Archives: Rain Code to the games its c...', NULL);

For decades, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"http://tevisthompson.com/saving-zelda/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"http://tevisthompson.com/saving-zelda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Zelda</em>’s design had stagnated</a></span>, becoming a rigid, lifeless sequence of locks and keys. The tales the games told were full of magic, but the gameplay had little magic or wonder to offer. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>changed all that, giving us a vast Hyrule full of natural beauty and magical mystery. The revelation that <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s follow-up would be a direct sequel, set in the same Hyrule and continuing the story of the same Link and the same Zelda, left me <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-totk-gameplay-fuse-weapon-car-meat-1850274230\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-totk-gameplay-fuse-weapon-car-meat-1850274230\">concerned that we might be back on the path to sameness</a></span>, that Nintendo might play it safe with sequels that just replicated that game’s design principles rather than finding new ways to build on the series’ potential. Instead, though, what we’ve gotten is another game of incredible inventiveness, one that encourages play in the truest sense, that reminds us, if we’ve forgotten, that the world is full of magic, after all.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h89030\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Forming a link with Hyrule</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Though <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s narrative saw an amnesia-ridden Link rediscovering memories of his own past that illuminated his connection with Princess Zelda, the real relationship at the game’s core was the one between Link and Hyrule itself. You’re constantly climbing rocks, and it always starts thunderstorming at the worst time. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>really brings its own terrain to the forefront, making you aware of the natural world around you in a way few games do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The result was a game where just being in the world was its own reward. I’d climb mountains not because I expected to find some valuable item at the top, but just because I wanted to see the view from up there. While so many games incentivize us to explore with the hope of finding some item that will make us better or faster or stronger (I’m currently scouring every nook and cranny of <em>Diablo IV </em>for Altars of Lilith and the incremental bonuses they bestow), this was real exploration, of the sort where I just wanted to see what’s around the next curve in the road for its own sake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Now <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>returns us to the same Hyrule. How can exploring the same Hyrule, one so many of us became so familiar with in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, remain compelling a second time around? Because the passage of time leaves its mark on all things, and this Hyrule is deeply marked by time. Specifically, an event called the Upheaval has left Hyrule greatly changed, bringing floating islands into view in the skies above, opening chasms to vast depths below, and generally leaving the landscape significantly altered.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">In many ways <em>The Legend of Zelda </em>has long been concerned with the passage of time—think of earlier subtitles like <em>A Link to the Past </em>and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, or the way that <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s Hyrule had <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://carolynpetit.tumblr.com/post/158836151500/breath-of-the-wild-and-the-magic-of-the-temple-of\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://carolynpetit.tumblr.com/post/158836151500/breath-of-the-wild-and-the-magic-of-the-temple-of\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">faded echoes of places</a></span> many of us have visited in earlier games in the series. But here in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, the way that its world is simultaneously so similar to and yet so different from that in the previous game means we see and feel the direct impact of what the Upheaval has wrought more keenly than we’ve felt the forces of change in Hyrule before. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">There’s Kakariko Village, still in some ways the peaceful little hamlet you remember but it’s got fallen ruins in the hills above it now. There’s the old Rito Stable, a place you might have once stopped to pick up your horse when heading into the cold northwestern region of Hebra, but it’s now home to a newspaper. For <em>Breath of the Wild </em>players at least, there’s a delicious tension between the familiar and the new at work here, not unlike returning to your childhood hometown after years away and being thrown off by all the ways it’s changed in your absence.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s exciting feeling that discovery awaits you everywhere is not just renewed in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, but enhanced. The world now stretches far beyond the familiar surface, with places to discover both high in the sky and far underground, and a thrilling assortment of new ways to do so. Gone are Link’s powers from <em>BotW</em>—his ability to summon a bomb out of thin air, or manifest a pillar of ice. In their stead is a fresh array of powers. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Ascend is a remarkable and intuitive new ability that lets Link launch himself straight up through solid terrain and emerge above. Not only is it a useful and fun way to elevate yourself to otherwise hard-to-reach places, but it also underscores the feeling the game creates that this is one cohesive, connected world. Once, upon using Ascend while deep in Hyrule’s subterranean Depths, I emerged to find myself atop a mountain, the blue sky above me. Of course I know the game had done plenty of loading while Link swam straight up through all those layers of rock, but the effect was nonetheless one of making me <em>feel </em>like this was a real place, with the Depths actually resting hundreds of feet below the surface.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"e5bff8bf1d0f7456971117ae4defc941\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e5bff8bf1d0f7456971117ae4defc941\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A bear is seen in the woods, viewed through a scope in Tears of the Kingdom.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"e5bff8bf1d0f7456971117ae4defc941\" data-recommend-id=\"image://e5bff8bf1d0f7456971117ae4defc941\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A bear is seen in the woods, viewed through a scope in Tears of the Kingdom.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">There’s also Recall, an ability which lets you rewind time for a given object. Players much cleverer than me have found <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-zelda-recall-best-use-1850565308\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-zelda-recall-best-use-1850565308\">all kinds of uses for this one</a></span>, and I can’t wait to see <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-zelda-speedrun-record-first-twitch-1850432539\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-zelda-speedrun-record-first-twitch-1850432539\">how speedrunners use this</a></span> and Link’s other new powers to finish the game in no time flat. Fuse, meanwhile, lets you magically combine objects with your melee weapons, arrows, and shields, enabling you to create all manner of useful tools and plenty of goofy oddities, too. There’s a childlike delight in thinking the way this game encourages you to think, and then following through on those ideas. “What if I slap this fire fruit on my arrow and then shoot at the red barrels in that bokoblin camp?” Well, things blow up real good, that’s what, but the real fun of it all is that there are so many different ways to approach any such situation.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">And crucial to that freedom is perhaps the game’s most impactful new ability, Ultrahand, and the bevy of new Zonai devices—the creations of an ancient, once-lost culture reappearing in Hyrule after the Upheaval—that you can acquire. Ultrahand lets you take just about anything and grab it, manipulate it, and, most importantly, effectively glue it to other things. It’s very simple, and yet opens up a staggering number of possibilities when you consider that among the devices you can acquire are gliders, fans, energy beams, balloons, wheels, cannons, springs, and more. There’s a tactile pleasure to the assembly process, too, a hands-on, arts-and-crafts feel to manipulating the objects in three-dimensional space and affixing them together.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Many inventive players have fashioned all kinds of <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-how-make-air-bike-map-underground-1850481187\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/tears-of-the-kingdom-how-make-air-bike-map-underground-1850481187\">useful vehicles</a></span> and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-tears-of-the-kingdom-fuse-weapons-break-1850446937\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-tears-of-the-kingdom-fuse-weapons-break-1850446937\">powerful war machines</a></span> capable of defeating even the most powerful beasts you might encounter in Hyrule. Me, I’m more basic. I feel pretty good about myself if I just manage to <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-totk-link-ultrahand-logs-crafting-1850437422\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-totk-link-ultrahand-logs-crafting-1850437422\">glue a few logs together</a></span> and position my makeshift creation just right so that I can climb to an area I wouldn’t otherwise be able to reach. But this, too, is a strength of the game. It rewards those who harness the full potential of those Zonai devices in their own remarkable creations, but it also allows you to approach any challenge in any number of ways. Games routinely tout the idea of “player freedom” but they often effectively mean, “You can kill these people by sneaking up on them or you can kill them by fighting them in the open.” In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, however, you truly feel free to solve the challenges it puts before you in countless ways.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h89031\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Link and Zelda, wounded heroes</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Heroes often pay a price. Luke loses a hand. Frodo a finger. Early in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, Link and Zelda have an encounter that costs Link an arm, and Zelda—well, I’m not telling, but she pays a price too. Link is promptly furnished with a new arm, but still, the loss feels potent, a promising start to a legend that may go on to actually grapple with the things legends grapple with. Life and death. Sacrifice. Grief. Those kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">And for a while, it seems that melancholy undercurrent may lend the story being told here some emotional or thematic weight. Scattered across this post-Upheaval Hyrule are massive geoglyphs, images that each hold in them a memory which sheds some light on where Zelda has gone. They’re a stunning new feature of the landscape, one you can glimpse even from a great distance, and it’s wonderfully rewarding to spot one far away, make your way there, and then inspect it closely for where the memory is actually located. Piecing together the mystery of Zelda’s disappearance is exciting, too, as it deepens the feeling of Hyrule as an ancient place, one with real history, where the past remains alive in the present.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">However, like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in which, narratively, Zelda single-handedly keeps Calamity Ganon at bay for 100 years while Link recovers his power, this tale largely sidelines the princess even while giving her something crucial to do. These stories seem written to fend off criticism about Zelda being “damseled,” giving defenders the ammunition to declare that, in them, she does incredibly heroic things, while still effectively damseling her by setting up a dynamic in which you, as Link, must find her, save her, undo the circumstance that has cost her so much. Perhaps one day we’ll get a <em>Zelda </em>game that actually acknowledges Zelda’s heroism in its structure and gameplay as well as its narrative rather than one that wants to have its cake and eat it too, making her “heroic” but marginalizing her at the same time.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Ganon, too, is a disappointment here. Link’s old archnemesis, the recurring embodiment of evil that Hyrule can’t seem to escape, has at times in the past been quite compelling. (Never more so than in <em>The Wind Waker</em>, in which <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://youtu.be/YsPEKgQNGlg\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://youtu.be/YsPEKgQNGlg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">he gives a brief monologue</a></span> that complicates his villainy and makes you wonder about the cost at which Hyrule’s relative prosperity has come.) In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, unfortunately, he is a one-note villain, his evil simple, without any real character or moral texture. And when you finally vanquish him, the ending largely squanders the potential of the beginning, forgoing any reckoning with loss in favor of a resolution that’s too tidy and light.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">But it’s the journey in <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>that matters most, not the destination, and as a journey, the main quest is often outstanding. It takes you to the far corners of the land, and like its predecessor’s main quest, it sees you connect with representatives of all of Hyrule’s peoples. Unlike its predecessor’s main quest, though, which saw you navigating your way through a number of fairly drab puzzle dungeons and fighting a similar boss at the end of each, here you get a series of much more memorable temples in which combat skills and clever thinking are equally emphasized and which each conclude with a unique and dramatic boss confrontation.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The quest also sees you navigating a storm-shrouded cluster of sky islands, venturing deep into the Depths below Hyrule, and riding on the back of a massive dragon. In terms of the imagery of it all, the scope and scale of it, it all feels as grand and mythic as you could hope for. <br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h89032\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Side quests and sightseeing</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">And yet that main quest, as great as it is, isn’t what makes Hyrule feel so alive, so rich and vast and lived-in. It’s in your more freeform wanderings—exploring that cave you stumbled upon, or checking out the schoolhouse in town, or chatting with a researcher who’s translating ancient texts the Upheaval has surfaced—that Hyrule comes to feel like a living, breathing world. That phrase is woefully overused when talking about games, but this is a rare instance where it actually applies.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"153eb8c5ef28e0adff0e9bd6fe3d27b8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://153eb8c5ef28e0adff0e9bd6fe3d27b8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'A bearded man named Ponthos asks Link, \"Are you really that interested in my orb?\" while a large orb sits in the foreground.\' data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"153eb8c5ef28e0adff0e9bd6fe3d27b8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://153eb8c5ef28e0adff0e9bd6fe3d27b8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\'A bearded man named Ponthos asks Link, \"Are you really that interested in my orb?\" while a large orb sits in the foreground.\' data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Everywhere you go there are people who need help, maybe with vanquishing a monster or running a group of pirates out of town but just as likely with being reminded of a favorite meal, or figuring out where some missing goats have run off to, or transporting musicians to a particular place for a little impromptu concert. In many games, combat and saving people are just about your only way of directly interacting with and impacting the world around you. Not here. And just as being in the world is its own reward, you’ll typically receive a little something for doing these quests but the real motivation is often just to experience them, to use the tools at your disposal to tackle the problem in whatever way you see fit.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">But even when you’re not doing one of the game’s 200+ side quests (some categorized as “side adventures”), Hyrule’s beauty, mystery, and danger make it a thrill to explore. I’m particularly fond of building airplanes out of gliders, fans, and control sticks, and soaring to new areas in the sky islands, which really do look and feel like products of another culture, with their floating spheres and strange technology.

I gather their eyeballs and then travel to the hot Gerudo Desert to face off against a Flame Gleeok, one of those three-headed dragons I mentioned. They’re a real pain, but by fusing the eyes of Ice Keese to my arrows, my shots get both homing and ice damage, giving me an edge in the fight. Everything feels connected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The late, great Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh often talked about what he called <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/esyQnwz_yJ0\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/esyQnwz_yJ0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interbeing</a></span>, the ways in which we are all always connected to everything around us. In <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>I wander alone, accompanied by what are effectively ghosts of people I know who, by being mere echoes of real people, only emphasize Link’s solitude and my own. And yet <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>always makes me feel deeply connected to Hyrule, and thus to all things. I hunt, I forage, I use the bounty of one region to aid me in another, I build, I create, I destroy, I witness, I take photos and catalog Hyrule’s wildlife. I soar and I spelunk. I help a guy put up signs. Some games are so player-focused that you feel like it’s all about you, like the world revolves around you. In <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, you feel that there is a vast tapestry of life going on around you, and you are just one part of it, as much a part of it as anyone else. I prefer this feeling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Link, as he has always been, remains a cipher here, someone <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://gizmodo.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-link-trans-1850430832\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://gizmodo.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-link-trans-1850430832\">any player can seamlessly project themselves onto</a></span>. Through him, we are there. I might play as Kratos in <em>God of War </em>but I’m always aware that I’m very much not Kratos, and that’s fine. Many games benefit from characters with defined, detailed personalities. But the way Link invites any of us in serves these games very well. Link is all of us, and by inhabiting him, we can fully inhabit the world this game offers us, with its stunning sunsets, its misty mornings.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">We often think of games as entertainment, and there’s nothing wrong with a game that just entertains us, but I want art that affects me more deeply too, sometimes. Not too long ago, I read this novel called <em>The Overstory</em> by Richard Powers. It’s a tale of people and environmental crisis but it’s also very much a tale of the natural world, of trees in particular, and after I read it, I couldn’t help but be more aware of the trees I saw everywhere as living things unto themselves. And that, of course, changed how I saw the world, how I saw our fate and the fate of trees as bound up together. <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>doesn’t explicitly try to drive home any such point, and I ultimately found its narrative underwhelming, but games have ways of making meaning that go beyond just the story they tell. There’s meaning in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> giving us a world that’s so full of life, where everyone’s and everything’s fate is interlinked, where you’re encouraged to play in the childlike sense, to use your imagination, to create and experiment and just see what happens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Like a great novel might, this game made me feel more connected to the world around me, and it put me in touch with feelings of wonder that I haven’t felt in a long time.

For so long, the series had lacked, in my view, any recognizable shred of real exploration, real play. But then, along comes a game like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which gives you both a wonderful world to explore and thrilling, imaginative new ways to explore it, and I get it. Playing this, I feel like a kid again, alive to the wondrous nature of the world, imagining myself on all kinds of incredible adventures. <br></p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/49c36fadfb062218b6e6c8509909f030.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840', 'I climb up onto a giant lilypad floating in the middle of a lake and it sinks un...', NULL);

That discomfort made me miss the <em>Metroid </em>games, which aren’t necessarily marketed to women, but do, I was surprised to learn at some point, revolve around the nonchalantly female bounty hunter Samus Aran. I loaded <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> with these memories in mind, hoping it would let me try a bit of what I missed when I was too young to even really understand what makes someone “a girl” (I’d just turned 4 when it was released for the GameCube in 2002).

Shortly after I arrive on the Pirates’ Orpheon spacecraft, copper-colored Tallon IV looking like a shiny penny in the distance, I am encouraged to shoot at enemies with my Pulse Beam. Boom. The Pirates go down. I’m told to press B while using the game’s very generous lock-on setting, which pulls the game’s already basic shooting elements down to their baseboard, to move around potential hits. Boom. A swarm of creatures vomit green goo at me. Some splats and slides off my visor, but I kill the creatures quickly.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">From this benign beginning, <em>Metroid Prime</em> establishes itself as more of a <em>Lara Croft</em>-type adventure than a shooter. Tense moments—the seconds after killing a boss, missing a jump and slipping into a pit of burning magma—are pinches to keep pushing forward, get the next bit of gear, go down another secret tunnel, add more Chozo history to my logbook.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82717\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>The same game but better</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It helps that this <em>Remastered</em> version looks so…remastered. I forget that this was first released for the GameCube in 2002, taken by the beads of orange light that peel off of Orpheon like spiderwebs illuminated by the hot sun, taken by its cute, cartoon-y graphics as I progress.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Samus’ eyebrows, through the reflection of her helmet, are perfect bark-colored rainbows. The fallible enemies, some with cases of ice on their backs like turtle shells, some crackling with painful white lines of electricity, and those Space Pirates with their long legs and jet packs, are richly colored like gummy bears.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But <em>Remastered</em> hasn’t forgotten where it came from. Aside from the default “dual-stick,” for modern, dual-stick control, the game offers robust controller settings, including “classic,” modeled after the GameCube controller, “pointer,” which operates “similar to <em>Metroid Prime: Trilogy</em> for Wii,” the game says, and “hybrid,” which combines dual-stick and classic. I play mostly with dual-stick, though I feel like hybrid is a fun limitation, with a sticky up-and-down control that I find beneficial to my motion sickness.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"edfaac60620f9c972f94311bedb08023\" data-recommend-id=\"image://edfaac60620f9c972f94311bedb08023\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2704\" data-height=\"1516\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus points a gun in Metroid Prime Remastered.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"edfaac60620f9c972f94311bedb08023\" data-recommend-id=\"image://edfaac60620f9c972f94311bedb08023\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2704\" data-height=\"1516\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus points a gun in Metroid Prime Remastered.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I appreciate that, too.

Without it, although rare, annoyances were more difficult to cover in candy.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As I progress through the game, I pick up expansions to my health bar and to my Power Suit, like a thermal visor, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Jump_Boots\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Jump_Boots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">boots</a></span> that help me do moon landing high jumps, and weapon expansions that help me shoot out missiles spun from purple light. The enemies that crowd the different environments I navigate and return to, hunt in, plunder, and return to stay at pretty much the same low-level difficulty because of this. I don’t mind that so much—quickly downing enemies helps make the game feel like an elastic snap, and I like moving on.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But repetitiveness and simplicity become less fun when it comes to the bosses, which either have tricks to them (a light beam you need to change the position of, some rocks you need to methodically obliterate) or require boringly little skill (hold B to avoid an attack, shoot until they die). By my fifth boss battle, I’m more annoyed than exhilarated, wanting to get it over as fast as possible so that I don’t have to double back to my last save station.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I can respect that purists <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/110f58b/metroid_prime_remastered_needs_an_autosave_feature/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/110f58b/metroid_prime_remastered_needs_an_autosave_feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like the save station</a></span>—the health-replenishing checkpoints are, for the most part, conveniently located in each new place you enter—but, like I said, this is a game that’s all about travel. Adventure, right? But when I trip into magma <em>again</em> and need to retrace 10 minutes worth of my steps, taking down the weak enemies that light that path <em>again</em>, I don’t feel challenged, I feel annoyed. Exploration, the crux of the game, turns into a chore.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At slower, more frustrating points of my playtime, I find it difficult to connect with the obscurity of Samus’ mission.

I can’t say I’m that personally invested in the Chozo’s demise, and the game isn’t heavy enough on mystery to make me want to be. It’s all pretty cut and dry, evil mutant stuff.<br></p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Metroid Prime Remastered\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"metroid-prime-remastered\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">To give myself more to chew on, halfway through, I turn on “full” narration settings, so that voiceover from the game’s original European and Japanese releases would play as I do. I’m disappointed when I realize that those old voices are confined to the opening and closing cutscenes, and to announcing locations, like the translated Ice Valley (Phendrana Drifts).<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h82718\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Samus Aran lives</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’m more interested in the careful details <em>Metroid Prime</em> uses to make up for its hashing and rehashing (it is a 2002 game, after all). The white-blue snowdrifts in the Phendrana region, the way water sloughs off Samus’ visor like she’s a stone in a river.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">They endear me to Samus, as silent and stoic as she is. Similarly to <em>Alien</em>’s Ripley, Samus is presented as refreshingly gender-neutral, her suit fixed with massive armored biceps, a bit of flat orange metal around her waist, too protective to allow for curves.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Remastered</em>’s graphics look great, and while the game continues to, for the most part, translate well as an expansive, engaging shooter, I’m most struck by how the game allows Samus to be a person. Not a woman with her baggage, sexualized and discarded like a <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em> sex worker from the same year, and not relegated to the background the way 2023’s <em>Dead Space</em> does to its female characters.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Metroid Prime</em> doesn’t linger on Samus’ fear, either, instead allowing Samus to navigate Tallon IV with indifference, something real women walking alone in the real world are rarely encouraged to have. But Samus never needs to hurry because <em>Metroid Prime</em> keeps her safe. And the immediacy in which she gets to exist has nothing to do with her gender. Unless I see her reflected eyes, fluttering with black mascara, in her visor, I’m not thinking about Samus’ gender or what she looks like.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And I’m thankful for that. I’m old enough now to witness girls partake in the video game industry outside of “girl games,” and to experience its full breadth for myself. <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> isn’t as perfect of a game as it seemed to be over 20 years ago. Too much time has passed for that to have ever been the case. But it will always know how to let a woman live.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> <br></p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Metroid Prime Remastered: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/016fdbb7f5748a5887da6c5400229317.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-kotaku-review-1850124313', 'I started growing up with games at a time when a lot of them weren’t advertised ...', NULL);

Despite the unprecedented popularity of that game, the series’ latest, <em>Fire Emblem Engage</em>, is a return to its fairytale roots. And as I played the game, I realized quickly that <em>Engage</em> was also taking inspiration from another source: the mobile gacha game <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em>. As Nintendo’s <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-heroes-profits-revenue-nintendo-billion-app-1849134777\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-heroes-profits-revenue-nintendo-billion-app-1849134777\">first billion-dollar mobile game</a></span>, it’s easy to understand why the developers chose that success story to influence their vision of the<em> Fire Emblem</em> multiverse. Unfortunately, what made for a solid mobile game ultimately doesn’t translate well to this console gaming experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em> is a tactics RPG where you battle magical zombies with swords and sorcery. You play as an amnesiac dragon (in human form) named Alear, who had been asleep for a thousand years. An evil dragon wakes up at the same time you do, and is determined to take over the world with the aid of his powerful minions. Like previous games, the goddess of the world chooses you to save the world. Unlike previous games, you accomplish this by fusing your soldiers with spirits called “Emblems,” who are the protagonists of previous <em>Fire Emblem</em> games. They also haunt physical rings called Emblem rings—which can be lost, stolen, or hidden in inconvenient places. While the main rings are obtained through the course of the story, some optional character rings can also be obtained from an in-game gacha system.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2bf51658f8e7729d7b31f9d1842d6854\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2bf51658f8e7729d7b31f9d1842d6854\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Celine syncs with Celica during battle.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2bf51658f8e7729d7b31f9d1842d6854\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2bf51658f8e7729d7b31f9d1842d6854\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Celine syncs with Celica during battle.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This isn’t the developers’ first attempt at a <em>Fire Emblem</em> multiverse. Intelligent Systems first experimented with inter-dimensional crossovers in 2012’s <em>Awakening </em>for the 3DS, in which players could recruit classic heroes (albeit without any interactions or dialogue). The 2017 hack-and-slash title <em>Fire Emblem Warriors</em> also featured characters from other worlds, though purist fans don’t consider the musou game as a main part of the franchise. <em>Heroes</em>, however, became an indispensable part of the franchise. While <em>Three Houses</em>, a very successful game by series standards, sold 4 million copies, the mobile game has been downloaded 18 million times. It showed not only that a <em>Fire Emblem</em> multiverse could be successful, but that it might be the most profitable way to sustain a franchise.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <em>Heroes</em> influence is most readily apparent in the flashy character designs, which make liberal use of bright, contrasting colors and unusual silhouettes. This is tolerable for two-person conversations, but any cutscenes involving three or more characters feel visually jarring. The drastic changes become even more apparent when you watch the new characters fight alongside the classic heroes. Established characters Byleth and Marth have cohesive appearances despite being created nearly 30 years apart. On the other hand, newcomers Princess Ivy and Prince Alfred wear so many clashing accessories, I was frequently distracted by their outfits during emotionally charged cutscenes. They didn’t just seem out of place in a medieval setting; their appearances actively undermined my attempts to take the story seriously. Which is a huge problem for a series that has always tried to seriously wrangle with war themes with varying degrees of success. </p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Fire Emblem: Engage\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"fire-emblem-engage\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The mobile-fication of <em>Engage </em>can also be seen in how the characters communicate with each other. Unlike the lively banter of the previous two games in the series, interactions between characters feel brief and disjointed. Oftentimes the dialogue isn’t even anime nonsense—it’s just nonsense. Discussions end abruptly, or they don’t flow organically. The conversations feel like they’re designed to be screenshotted and shareable on social media, and the overall narrative experience suffers for it. I’ve never felt compelled to skip the dialogue in a <em>Fire Emblem </em>game before. In <em>Engage, </em>however, I lied to myself as I fast-forwarded my way through a couple of support conversations: “I’ll come back to view it later.” Dozens of painfully dull conversations later, I don’t think I ever will. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is all forgivable in a mobile game where casual players are engaging with dozens of characters in small increments of time, and they don’t have the mental bandwidth for the complexity of a traditional <em>Fire Emblem</em> game. It just doesn’t work, however, for a console game where players expect to be immersed in a world for hours on end. <em>Engage</em> is so shallow about its worldbuilding and characters that I find myself feeling unattached to any of them. When the main character proclaimed that she wants to save the world even at the cost of her own life, I found myself asking: Why? What are the specific things that she believes are worth saving? <em>Awakening</em>’s similarly amnesiac protagonist had a believable redemption arc because the game centered their relationships with other important characters. In contrast, Alear feels like a figurehead to many but a friend to none. There’s a lot of interesting territory to be explored about the detached nature of a messiah’s relationship to their followers, but it never materializes in this game. Again and again, Alear asks their followers to treat them like a friend. Yet the game never shows the small ways in which the characters depend on one another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What little character development <em>Engage</em> manages to accomplish is ultimately undone by its clumsy attempts at redeeming its villains. One of its protagonists has an evil, murderous personality caused by psychological abuse. Her cultist abusers pull unbelievable heel-face turns at the eleventh hour, and the victim immediately absolves them of all blame. I don’t <em>enjoy</em> these narratives, but I can buy into a convincing performance. Unfortunately, the voice work just can’t salvage poor writing. There’s one particular endgame scene about motherhood that made me want to shrivel up and die. If <em>Three Houses</em> was two steps forward for mature video game storytelling about warfare, then <em>Engage</em> is ten steps back. Even when a plot twist seems conceptually interesting, the terrible delivery manages to sabotage any sense of gravitas.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The emptiness of <em>Engage</em> feels especially tragic because it had all the fundamentals for a great game. The animated cutscenes are beautiful for a game housed on the ancient Nintendo Switch system, and the live-rendering is better than it ever was in <em>Three Houses</em>. I just wish it had been more consistent about the kinds of stories that the developers were trying to tell. There were moments of grounded realism and motions at emotional sincerity. These were the times when I held my breath and waited for <em>Engage</em> to replicate the magic that drew me to the series over the course of a decade. They never came. Despite the feeble attempts at fan nostalgia, even my favorite characters such as Celica and Byleth felt shallower than they did in their original titles. <em>Engage</em> had all the correct ingredients of a compelling <em>Fire Emblem</em> game—but the script did not break from shallow one-liners or trite melodrama. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2a20e9c38f9f7e98e43f1374731cefb0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2a20e9c38f9f7e98e43f1374731cefb0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Alear is selected on a top-down map.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2a20e9c38f9f7e98e43f1374731cefb0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2a20e9c38f9f7e98e43f1374731cefb0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Alear is selected on a top-down map.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Fortunately, I spent more time <em>engaging </em>with the combat system than the story. Out of all the modern <em>Fire Emblem</em> games I’ve played, <em>Engage</em> feels the most balanced. I thought that the Emblem rings were an annoying gimmick at first. I later came to appreciate that they offered me character customizability without child marriage or eugenics (looking at you, <em>Awakening</em> and <em>Fates</em>). If I decided that I no longer wanted my thief to moonlight as a mage, then I could simply swap her Micaiah ring for a Lucina one. While this system may seem egalitarian on paper, the game still forces you to pick and choose favorites within your army. There are a very limited number of deployment slots per map, and you’ll probably want to pick the royal characters because of their disproportionate plot relevance. This meant that I ended up neglecting over half of my total roster—something that I rarely did in other <em>Fire Emblem</em> games. But <em>did</em> I want to spread the experience equally across 30 people? Probably not. I felt obligated to in prior games because I had conversations to unlock. I didn’t have this problem with <em>Engage</em>, which didn’t give me anything interesting enough to unlock. That’s one way to design around FOMO, I suppose.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I like the improvements <em>Engage </em>makes to the traditional rock-paper-scissors nature of the series’ weapons triangle. <em>Fire Emblem</em> normally tries to balance things by adding or subtracting weapon weaknesses. Magic spells in the classic games would require different types of counters. In <em>Awakening</em>, you’d counter archers with abilities that made it easier to hit archers and dodge their attacks. <em>Engage</em> simplifies the system while retaining tactical complexity. Fists are effective against bows and magic, which still retain the upper hand with their extended range. The lance-sword-axe weapons triangle still exists, but disadvantages hurt more than in previous games. If an enemy hits you with a superior weapon, then your character loses the ability to counterattack for the entire round. That meant that I could no longer send out a beefy armored character to bait attacks during the enemy’s turn like I might in another game. And positioning has become even <em>more</em> important in <em>Engage</em>, where multiple enemies can <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-engage-chain-attack-backup-morion-switch-1850048383\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-engage-chain-attack-backup-morion-switch-1850048383\">chain attack</a></span> you at once. While other aspects of the game have tried to appeal to a more mainstream audience, the combat in <em>Engage</em> remains deep and satisfying. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Like its predecessor <em>Three Houses</em>, <em>Engage</em> brings back the <em>Persona</em>-esque minigames that allow you to train other characters or to spend free time with them. They also seem to be even more optional than in previous games. I didn’t finish <em>Three Hopes</em> because every chapter became a depressing resource grind in which I went back and forth across the map in order to manage upgrades and conversions. This was caused by the fact that I had a limited number of activity points to spend every chapter. There isn’t a similar limit here. <em>Engage</em> offered me a feast of minigames, and the freedom to play them to my heart’s content. I could go fishing, coordinate meals, adopt stray animals after every battle, exercise, or pit my soldiers against each other in gladiatorial combat. The social rewards in <em>Engage</em> feel so negligible or easily obtained that I would complete several consecutive chapters without ever returning to my home base. I know that I complained about the endless activities, but Alear’s castle feels like a step too far out in the other direction. I felt like I had a schedule and a sense of belonging as a professor in <em>Three Houses</em>. For the past forty or so hours, I was funemployed—with all the freedom and boredom that it entailed.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2fb557d63e27067d34a1006d2d01a37c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2fb557d63e27067d34a1006d2d01a37c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Alear has toast dinner with two companions.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2fb557d63e27067d34a1006d2d01a37c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2fb557d63e27067d34a1006d2d01a37c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Alear has toast dinner with two companions.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Social progression feels more casual compared to <em>Three Houses</em> or <em>Three Hopes</em>, where I was constantly rushing to max out some relationship stat before terrible consequences befell certain characters. In <em>Engage</em>, by contrast, the members of my current army barely know their own siblings. I have decided that this is fine. I’ve spent more time trying to adopt stray cats in the countryside than I’ve spent speaking to my own soldiers. <em>Engage</em> doesn’t pretend to be about getting close to those who would risk life and limb for you. Followers are required to worship, but gods are not required to give.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><br>I’ve always believed that mobile games are an <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/diablo-immortal-blizzard-metacritic-f2p-1849059627\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/diablo-immortal-blizzard-metacritic-f2p-1849059627\">approachable gateway for new fans to enjoy an otherwise esoteric IP</a></span>, and <em>Engage</em> streamlines the gameplay in all the right ways. Unfortunately, though, the story falls short of what I’ve come to expect from any <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, and I’m still struggling to understand <em>why</em>. With <em>Fates</em>, the poor writing could be attributed to its sheer character bloat, but <em>Engage</em> has a reasonably normal-sized cast. The watered-down stories felt like an intentional appeal to capture new audiences. But at some point, I want to move on from the appetizer to the main course. With its disposable conversations, shallow handling of themes, and incohesive visual design, <em>Engage</em> is the chicken wing, rather than a full chicken dinner. </p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Fire Emblem Engage: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/759a91400dadd924816b90941d59f3ee.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-engage-review-nintendo-switch-three-houses-1850059780', 'With its somewhat more grounded depictions of military life and interpersonal tr...', NULL);

I talk big about wanting innovative gameplay but, in a <em>Pokémon</em> title at least, I wanted the familiar comforts of knowing exactly what to do. I wanted up to be north, and down to be south. None of those things were true in<em> Pokémon Scarlet</em>. While struggling to gain a foothold on the frustratingly ambiguous mountainside—one where safe, snowy pathways can be hard to distinguish from treacherous cliffs—I found myself ambushed by a vicious Ice-type Cetoddle who had snuck up in my blind spot. He boinked me, and a battle for my life began.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve played every <em>Pokémon </em>generation since<em> Red </em>on the Game Boy Color, and the basic formula has mostly remained the same. You navigate a labyrinth world connected by routes, battle monsters in a turn-based system, and run around certain tiles until the RNG spits out a Pokémon for you. In <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, on the other hand, you’re traversing an open world without any routes, you can see potential opponents from far away, and you choose your battles with careful precision. </p>\n\n<aside class=\"sc-o6p93a-0 gJydMU\"><span class=\"sc-196v4ms-0 bpQblS\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span><span class=\"sc-a3cloy-0 bzNnZL\">The shift to open-world exploration has sacrificed the specificity of Pokémon world design. ﻿</span><span class=\"sc-196v4ms-0 bpQblS\" contenteditable=\"false\"></span></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Rather than subjecting you to the tyranny of closed exploration, <em>Scarlet</em> wants to give you more freedom than any title that came before it. Most of the game, you’re traveling on a version-exclusive motorbike Pokémon, Koraidon (<em>Scarlet</em>) or Miraidon (<em>Violet</em>). The Pokémon Center and Pokémarts are located in gas stations. The biggest sell is that there’s no set path that you have to follow. You can go to towns in any order and fight villainous bosses whenever you’d like. Unlike some open-world games, the enemies’ levels do not scale with your own. So if you stumble upon a level 40 Medicham while your Pokémon are level 18 like I did…well, I hope you’ve brought Poké Dolls to distract them.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But <em>Scarlet</em> is a lackluster exploration game. I’ve spent several days in the new region of Paldea, and it’s still as strange and unfamiliar to me as the day I left the starter town of Cabo Poco. Most open-world games rely on strong visual landmarks to help the player find their way. Paldea is largely empty, with very few landmarks on the long stretches of wilderness aside from the occasional gas station. While I was looking for the particularly out-of-the-way city of Alformada, I got lost several times. NPC trainers and signage mocked me constantly. Did you get lost too? Didn’t you know this is the wrong way? I thought the cheeky humor was funny at first. But when I compared my adventure to those in previous Pokémon games, I realized that the series’ transition to the newer design sensibilities had come at a cost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The shift to open-world exploration has sacrificed the specificity of <em>Pokémon</em> world design. Though every region in past games had dozens of grassy routes, each one felt unique. If you showed me a screenshot of one of those older games, there was a strong chance I could identify where it was taken. Meanwhile, I’ve traveled Paldea for dozens of hours, and I couldn’t tell you anything about the surrounding areas of each city. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Confronted with all this nondescript blandness I thought to myself: What a waste. Maybe it’s because I enjoy traveling in real life. Ever since I was a child, I’ve loved the intricacies of figuring out how to navigate a new place. Roads were places where infinite sky met infinite earth, and every single rest stop was a welcome reprieve, every stranger a spot of humanity. Travel is about learning to love what you might not care for in any other circumstances. But the people I met on the road in Paldea were all NPC trainers. Gas station owners had no role other than to reward me for battling all of the nearby opponents. So it felt like I was “collecting” victories from roadside trainers rather than taking a genuine interest in challenging them organically. And oftentimes, I found myself with my nose to the ground. I’d be watching for sparkling items on the floor, or carefully keeping my eyes peeled for any sudden ambushes from the grass. Even if Paldea had been beautiful, the gameplay discouraged me from looking up and taking it all in.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I know that the central conceit of this series is to find and capture your favorite Pokémon. But if a game tries to offer an open-world experience, then I want to be a tourist. Every bland-looking cliff, every forest, and every river felt more like an obstacle rather than a natural wonder. After a decade, I still think fondly of the solemn tranquility of Mount Coronet from <em>Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>. I remember standing on the peak of Mount Silver and feeling that I stood upon the legacy of giants. In comparison, Paldea’s Mt. Glaseado feels like a steep, ordinary hill. There was no glory in conquering its heights, no sense of having challenged myself to explore its snowy depths. In fact, I often found myself there by accident. World design in previous games felt precise and intentional, funneling me through puzzle dungeons. It was intimate and cozy. <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>took that away and replaced it with a subpar open-world experience.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b8649440f3d61d904d24cce6867532a3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b8649440f3d61d904d24cce6867532a3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The camera clips through the floor under Skeledirge. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b8649440f3d61d904d24cce6867532a3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b8649440f3d61d904d24cce6867532a3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The camera clips through the floor under Skeledirge. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And then there are <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-bugs-performance-paldea-nintendo-1849798801\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-bugs-performance-paldea-nintendo-1849798801\">the performance issues</a></span>. Of course, we’ve known about them for a couple of weeks now, and I’d seen them in various tweets and videos. Nothing prepared me, however, for just how hostile the world felt when the camera clipped through an object, or when moving NPCs started stuttering randomly. When I threw a Pokéball, it would often get stuck in midair. While battling an opponent in water, I’d pray that my Pokémon wouldn’t fall into the lake. Although the errors can sometimes be funny, I ended up becoming jaded about the experience over time. I couldn’t trust the camera to follow, or the walls to have proper hitboxes. While I bugged through the floor for the fifth time, I remembered how <em>Kotaku</em> staff had argued about whether or not it mattered that <em>Legends: Arceus</em> looked like ass. Does it matter if <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> have visual glitches, so long as it’s fun? To me, the answer is a resounding yes. I don’t buy <em>Pokémon</em> games for combat. I play them to simulate the feeling of having cute shared experiences with my Pokémon. As I watched the moonlight turn my electric mouse Pawmot into an unnatural shade of gray, I felt that I wasn’t getting the quality Pokémon experience that I was accustomed to.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Scarlet also lacks the grinding of older generations, which may sound good on paper, but in practice meant that I spent less time being mindful about how I trained Pokémon. I understand this is a longstanding pivot in the series that has taken place over several generations. The developers want you to get through the main story as quickly as possible so that you can get to the endgame of raising the toughest monsters for competitive or multiplayer play, or to be able to spend the whole game breeding shiny Pokémon if that’s your thing. But as I watched my entire party level up at the same time, I felt nostalgic for the days when trying to level a Magikarp was a ritual of love and dedication. Yeah, its nonexistent moveset was a source of frustration. And yes, I had to constantly work to make sure my starter Pokémon’s development didn’t outpace that of their siblings. But a reasonable amount of micromanagement was a way for me to invest care into my favorites. Getting a Volcarona felt awesome because you’d raised a Larvesta from birth to level 59. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Now I just catch a wild Gible at level 40 and shove some EXP candies into its mouth. Or I take my Pokémon out of its ball, and let it battle by itself while I make my way toward our next destination. It doesn’t feel like we endured the struggle together. There isn’t a huge opportunity cost in choosing to raise one companion over another, so I could use new Pokémon at any time without guilt. Which may be fine for players who are new to the series, but I can’t help but feel that they’re missing out on what once made raising each Pokémon feel like a unique experience. If I didn’t want to feel the highs and lows of lugging around a Magikarp in the hopes that it would evolve into Gyarados, then I would have simply left them at the daycare (which raises your Pokémon for you). Now <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> continue to feel like daycare all the time. Again, this could have been fine if I found exploration to be more compelling than the actual battles. But I didn’t. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The battles are also simply…fine. You know what to expect: Throw out a Pokémon and watch them battle it out in turn-based combat. Paldea adds a smorgasbord of over a hundred new Pokémon to collect, and the roster seems primarily aimed at countering the Fairy-type, which has been fairly overpowered since it was introduced in <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. I found it extremely easy to pick up powerful Steel and Poison-type creatures compared to other games, and my Fairy-type Dachsbun wasn’t simply steamrolling every single Pokémon I met. I habitually build a team out of new Pokémon only available in that specific generation. If you want a Fire or Water type, then you’re better off trying to catch some of the older Pokémon. With the exception of the new Paradox Pokémon, Paldea isn’t trying to give us new powerhouses like Dragapult or Mimikyu—the new creatures have unique type combinations or special ability gimmicks. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ad3e0f1e9e6f59156bbeca0bba7e6beb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ad3e0f1e9e6f59156bbeca0bba7e6beb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Scyther Terastallizes.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ad3e0f1e9e6f59156bbeca0bba7e6beb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ad3e0f1e9e6f59156bbeca0bba7e6beb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Scyther Terastallizes.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Tera types, another new addition to the series, are also not very groundbreaking. Terastallizing is a process in which you change your Pokémon’s type to a single mono type (each of which is unique to that specific Pokémon). So one Pikachu’s Tera Type can be Electric, another could be Grass, and a different one could be Dark. There’s a big catch: You can only Terastallize once per battle, and you can’t do it again until you return to a Pokémon Center. So this ability is really nerfed compared to <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>’s Mega Evolution or Gigantimaxing in <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em>. You should only use it in a pinch, but this ability is not suited for long travels or engaging with multiple waves of opponents.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some special trainers like Gym Leaders will Terastallize their Pokémon in battle, but they only do so for the last Pokémon in their party (and always for their specialized type). So this mechanic doesn’t make gyms any more challenging. I am confident that you could ignore Tera types for most of the game and come out with a pretty okay experience. By the time I made it to the endgame, I had mostly forgotten that it existed. They’re pretty, but don’t expect Tera Types to massively alter your experience. I understand that there’s only a certain amount of complexity that the <em>Pokémon</em> meta can take before it can be difficult for newcomers. But I remember when Pokémon started being able to hold items. When they acquired natures and battles had weather conditions. I remember when the developers were experimenting with triple and rotation battles. I wish that <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> had been able to introduce a new system that could significantly change how Pokémon were used in battle, and which new combinations are now competitive. It feels as if the developers are reluctant to significantly disrupt competitive play, and casual players get lackluster gimmicks because of it.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Pokémon Scarlet and Violet\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"pok-mon-scarlet-and-violet\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s story is also not going to blow you away. As usual, it’s just a means of motivating you into traveling the land to battle and collect every Pokémon out there. Allowing players to complete quests in whichever order they chose is unique to the <em>Pokémon</em> games, but it’s not innovative in the wider RPG genre. But <em>Scarlet</em>’s story is nonetheless an improvement over several previous titles because it focuses on the relationships between people, rather than people and their Pokémon.

But it was relatable that Team Star, the primary antagonists of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, are committing delinquent acts to keep their friend group together. I was heartsick for these kids even though I wanted to shake them and go “Just talk it out with each other!” And though Arven, the professor’s son who has a strained relationship with his parent, was clearly meant to go from “surly rival” to “my best friend,” I enjoyed watching him slowly open up to other characters in the cast. While I’m unsure about several other aspects of the game, I’m glad that the series’ writers no longer have to rely on trainer-Pokémon bonds to tell compelling stories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><br>I know, I know, I’ve <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-bugs-performance-paldea-nintendo-1849798801\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-bugs-performance-paldea-nintendo-1849798801\">had my fun</a></span> mocking the visual glitches and performance issues in <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and<em> Violet. </em>But I really hope that the performance issues don’t ultimately define how we talk about this generation of games.

Now that <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s here and I’ve finally rolled credits, I kinda wish that it wasn’t made in the first place. Although <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is chock full of shiny new weapons and monsters to test them out on, there’s not enough fanservice in the world to make up for how much of a catastrophic letdown it is, thanks to its garbage fire of a story and its mistreatment of beloved characters. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">PlatinumGames’ <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is a character action hack-n-slash game.

Although <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s launch should be cause for celebration given that it coincides with the series’ <!-- -->anniversary, its legacy won’t be one of triumph; this is the worst game in the trilogy for how it rakes fans over piping-hot coals during the march toward its lackluster finale.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">By and large, <em>Bayonetta</em> games are rollercoaster rides of high-octane action that let you unleash a multitude of satisfying combos upon waves of monsters amid creative combat arenas.

Usually, fans can excuse these shortcomings because they don’t dampen the thrill of the bonkers rollercoaster ride of Bayonetta’s infectious bravado and combat prowess.

In prior <em>Bayonetta</em> games, chapters felt wholly unique to one another thanks to their inventive setpieces. In one moment you could be fighting a bunch of angels in the Vatican, and the next you’re surfing through a typhoon contending with a giant manta ray. Although <em>Bayonetta 3</em> has its fair share of enthralling setpieces, progressing through <em>Bayonetta 3</em> begins to feel like sleepwalking through the same concepts over and over.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s stages proceed as follows:<br></p>\n<ul data-type=\"List\" data-style=\"Bullet\" class=\"sc-1lmbno3-0 iPScqk\">\n<li>Meet a Bayonetta from an alternative universe</li>\n<li>Witness Alt.

The game features a dedicated waypoint-toggle button so you don’t have to guess which routes lead to bonus items and optional challenges and which lead to story progress. You may want to give the extra stuff a skip, though, as <em>Bayonetta 3 </em>becomes exhausting to play if you try for a completionist run.

While completing these trials does unlock stuff like new items and moves over the course of the game, the flurry of challenges mostly serve as padding to space out <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s half-baked story.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Visually speaking, <em>Bayonetta 3 </em>isn’t much of a looker. For whatever reason, the graphical artifacts on everyone’s faces make them look like they’re made out of sandpaper, especially in the Switch’s handheld mode. While I usually don’t harp on a game’s graphics, it was hard not to notice that Bayonetta’s model looked smoother and shinier in the eight-year-old <em>Bayonetta 2</em>. <em>Bayonetta 3</em> has a new, barebones photo mode feature, but it seems pointless.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"4aa4286d26c1adbb9ddfff2ae0d5b277\" data-recommend-id=\"image://4aa4286d26c1adbb9ddfff2ae0d5b277\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Bayonetta shoots homunculi while riding the back of an infernal bird demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"4aa4286d26c1adbb9ddfff2ae0d5b277\" data-recommend-id=\"image://4aa4286d26c1adbb9ddfff2ae0d5b277\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Bayonetta shoots homunculi while riding the back of an infernal bird demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Combat-wise, <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is arguably the best the series has ever been, a pure platinum sparkly statue of the witch herself, if you were to grade it on the game’s combat results scale. One new gimmick in <em>Bayonetta 3</em> lets you take control of demons on the battlefield. However, doing so makes Bayonetta immobile, so you’ll need to be cognizant of where she’s positioned so your combos aren’t unceremoniously interrupted by an attacking enemy.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Another, Demon Masquerade, allows Bayonetta to fuse with her weapons, take on their form, and unleash a flurry of demonic combos at the cost of magic power. My favorite Demon Masquerades were Dead End Express and Ribbit Libido-BZ55l, which <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/bayonetta-3-train-transformation-masquerade-boycott-1849687891\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/bayonetta-3-train-transformation-masquerade-boycott-1849687891\">transformed Bayonetta into a demonic train</a></span> and turned her singing voice into a weapon, respectively. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Demon Masquerade is a much-welcomed addition to Bayonetta’s toolkit, adding a whole new dimension to the game’s combat by letting your domesticated demon start your combos or serve as an exclamation point. The only downside here is how unsatisfying it feels to use these attacks against the uninspired new enemies. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"0f98396327e31fe44949ce727bcbcff2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0f98396327e31fe44949ce727bcbcff2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Bayonetta bonks the head of a giant spider demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"0f98396327e31fe44949ce727bcbcff2\" data-recommend-id=\"image://0f98396327e31fe44949ce727bcbcff2\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Bayonetta bonks the head of a giant spider demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s main enemy types are homunculi, artificial constructs created by corrupted humans. Their humanoid forms are a bore to hack through and even less impressive visually because of their bland, neon green <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/growing-up-as-a-taiwanese-american-gamer-was-the-best-o-1844282803\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/growing-up-as-a-taiwanese-american-gamer-was-the-best-o-1844282803\">Pepsiman</a></span> designs. The challenge modes give you a break from the lackluster homunculi by bringing back the infernal demons and angels from prior games, but this backfired in that it just made me long to play <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s predecessors instead. While the new additions to the game’s combat system managed to coax me out of outright hating the 20 hours I spent playing <em>Bayonetta 3</em>, its storytelling left me questioning whether it was worth the five-year wait.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The one shining light in <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s story is its new playable character, Viola. Similarly to how Nero was a breath of fresh air for the <em>Devil May Cry </em>series, so too is Viola in <em>Bayonetta 3</em> thanks to her charming personality and killer moves. In contrast to Bayo and Jeanne’s suave and snooty dommy mommy personas, Viola is a clumsy punk rocker girl who trips over her would-be-cool one-liners and bumbles her way through boss battles. However, her antics never cross the line from endearing to grating thanks to how charming she is. Instead of triggering witch time through dodging, Viola parries attacks with her long katana. This takes some getting used to, since prior <em>Bayonetta</em> games taught us to dodge whenever possible.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Unfortunately, Viola’s inclusion is marred by the relatively limited time you get to play as her in comparison to Bayonetta, as well as a major story beat.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"7c24c6a46a3fbe33c7646ddbc29267ff\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7c24c6a46a3fbe33c7646ddbc29267ff\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Viola braces herself for an attack from an infernal demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"7c24c6a46a3fbe33c7646ddbc29267ff\" data-recommend-id=\"image://7c24c6a46a3fbe33c7646ddbc29267ff\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Viola braces herself for an attack from an infernal demon. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In chapter seven—the midway point of the game—it’s revealed that Bayonetta and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://bayonetta.fandom.com/wiki/Luka\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://bayonetta.fandom.com/wiki/Luka\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luka</a></span>, the failson journalist, are Viola’s parents. Previously, Luka served as a predominantly unreliable character who could only competently serve as comedic relief for Bayonetta to emasculate. But in <em>Bayonetta 3</em>, the Umbran witch treats Luka like a husband she can’t take anywhere, her little mew mew. It’s also revealed that Luka is the werewolf-like infernal beast that gave Bayonetta and Viola trouble in previous chapters, despite him never having that kind of power in previous games.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While I’d prepared myself for the other stiletto to drop after this bizarre revelation, no amount of prep time could cushion how frustrating it was to witness <em>Bayonetta 3</em> push Luka down my throat both as a big-time player within the franchise and as Bayonetta’s love interest when Jeanne, a better-written character who has much more chemistry with Bayo, was being misused left and right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Since Bayonetta first debuted in 2009, the lanky witch has been <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.polygon.com/23417059/bayonetta-3-lgbtq-gay-queer-icon-fandom\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23417059/bayonetta-3-lgbtq-gay-queer-icon-fandom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an icon in the LGBTQ+ community</a></span>, celebrated by queer fans.

Turns out Dr. Sigurd, a character whom Jeanne was charged with rescuing during a side-scrolling <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>-esque spy quest, was Singularity all along. Even when the game threw Jeanne a bone by giving her something to do instead of being a damsel in distress, it was all to just kill her off, making the time spent during her missions feel pointless. At this point, I opted to skip out on most of the once-enjoyable witch- and time trials and just mainline the rest of the plot so I didn’t need to spend any more time than necessary playing <em>Bayonetta 3</em>.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I could give a gory blow-by-blow on all the ways <em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s third-act plotting fails the character and her fans, but suffice it to say that PlatinumGames let me down one last time by killing Bayonetta off too.

What’s more, it pulls off this feat while telling not just one tale but eight delightful, seemingly unrelated short stories that span space and time.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Live A Live</em>, by Square Enix, is a remake of the 1994 RPG of the same name for the Super Famicom that’s never before received an official western release.

In it, you play as a Shifu, a martial arts master approaching the twilight years of his life. In his final days, the Shifu trains three rapscallion pupils in the ways of his dying martial arts in hopes of keeping his craft alive. Throughout their training, you dictate which students require extra rearing in Shifu’s Earthen Heart discipline by sparring with them more often than the others. The pupils, in turn, replicate the moves they learn from Shifu after being bested by him during training. However, the more the three improve, the more Shifu’s fighting ability decreases. Role-playing games so often give us a constantly rewarding sense of progression for all of our experience; here, those mechanics are used to poignantly communicate a sense of aging and decline.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Before their training can bear fruit, a rival school attacks Shifu’s dojo, killing two of his pupils. Not wanting to doom his surviving pupil with the cycle of revenge, Shifu sets out alone for one final battle against the rival school in a <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Death\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Death\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Game of Death</em></a></span>-esque battle, leaving his once-cowardly student behind. I won’t give away how Shifu’s tale ends, but its thematic throughline of imparting life lessons and unearthing the latent potential within people society deems as worthless hits every bit as hard as Shifu’s ultimate technique, Heavenly Peaks Descent.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Even the game’s weaker chapters found a way to keep me engaged thanks to their gameplay gimmicks and homages to popular media in their respective genres. For example, let’s take the present day chapter. Subtitled The Strongest, this tale evokes the structure of wrestling and fighting games as it focuses on one man’s quest to assert himself as the greatest fighter in the world. In pursuit of this glory, he travels the globe, taking on the masters of a variety of fighting disciplines.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9831284a16455575239961910c3456cb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9831284a16455575239961910c3456cb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Masaru Takahara kicks in jubilation after learning the german suplex. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9831284a16455575239961910c3456cb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9831284a16455575239961910c3456cb\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Masaru Takahara kicks in jubilation after learning the german suplex. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The cliché structure initially led The Strongest to feel like it was going to be your standard fight-night chapter, but it actually approaches this tried-and-true territory with real cleverness and enthusiasm. The best part: you can bait moves out of your opponents so you can add them into your arsenal. Needless to say, seeing the prompt “German Suplex learned” gave me a visceral sense of accomplishment no other game to date has ever given me. Present Day: The Strongest quickly became Present Day: Suplex City because that move was strong as hell.

Learning the range of both an enemy’s attacks and your own raises the effectiveness of your turns. In the near future chapter, for instance, the best example of efficient tile management comes as you defeat goons with protagonist Akira’s hypnotic psychic powers.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b7c99a5979a9269afcf6b85dd6993a8c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b7c99a5979a9269afcf6b85dd6993a8c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Akira winds up for a psychic attack against a biker gang.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b7c99a5979a9269afcf6b85dd6993a8c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b7c99a5979a9269afcf6b85dd6993a8c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Akira winds up for a psychic attack against a biker gang.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Akira has the ability to read people’s minds. These psychic powers unearth an individual’s inner-most thoughts, but in battle they manifest as powerful, and ridiculous, psychic attacks. Akira’s major strength in the battlefield isn’t his punches or kicks, but his disorienting psychic attacks, some of which he can use on multiple enemies at once. Unlike the knight or rook-style chess movements of <em>Live A Live</em>’s physical attacks, Akira’s psychic abilities affect a generous column of tiles affecting as many enemies as possible. One such attack is Mother’s Shame–an attack that confuses enemies by invading their minds with thoughts of their mothers, causing them to lose the will to fight. Imagine preparing to put hands on someone, and then suddenly reliving in excruciating detail that time your mom tore your ass out the frame for not thawing out the chicken like she asked you to in front of all your friends. How terrifying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Depending on the type of attack you dish out, you can give tiles elemental damage that chips away at enemies before their turns. For the prehistoric chapter, that means shitting and farting on enemy cavemen and ancient beasts alike. It’s super effective.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Live A Live \" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"live-a-live\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Visually speaking,<em> Live A Live</em>, a pretty standard pixel-art JRPG in its original incarnation, has now been given the HD2D treatment of games like <em>Octopath Traveler </em>and <em>Triangle Strategy</em>. The result is occasionally breathtaking, though those moments are mostly thanks to the game’s use of depth of field, bloom effects, and the bonkers sprite detail during its climactic boss fights. However, don’t let the cutesy sprites fool you: <em>Live A Live</em> is rated T<!-- -->, and for good reason.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game might be called <em>Live A Live</em>, but folks nevertheless die unceremonious, gruesome deaths throughout its multiple chapters, be it at the hands of a vengeful martial artist, a troupe of dastardly bandits, a demonic dinosaur, or perhaps worst of all, a giant chicken kaiju. On the lighter side, <em>Live A Live</em> left me jokingly clutching pearls at the swearing, snarky comebacks, and brutally honest motivations for its protagonists. Hell, the driving motivation for the plucky caveman Pogo and his ape friend Gori in Prehistory: The First involves rescuing a woman and a band of gorillas so the duo can eventually bust their first nut. It be like that sometimes, I suppose. Instead of being tonally jarring, these absurd and light-hearted moments sing as a much-needed counterbalance to the game’s more somber and tragic events.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And without giving anything away, <em>Live A Live</em> culminates towards a powerful conclusion that will have its time-spanning heroes living on in your memory long after its credits roll…for the ninth time.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">      <!-- -->   <br></p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Live A Live: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/6e9ec19d28df459e42ab8a6def3e8513.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/live-a-live-nintendo-switch-review-remake-square-enix-1849338456', 'Live A Live is a pixel-art role-playing game that’s here for a good time, not a ...', NULL);

What happens when the Force no longer favors you? Can you survive when you walk away from being the chosen one? <em>KotOR 2</em> shows you the dead, unbeating heart of an endlessly vast and uncaring galaxy. Instead of fully committing itself to space-western fantasy like its BioWare-made predecessor, <em>KotOR 2</em> is a razor-sharp interrogation of whether the <em>Star Wars</em> universe needs to exist at all. It withholds the gentle nostalgia evoked by the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867\">most recent <em>Legos Star Wars</em> game</a></span>, and I respect it for demanding my skepticism of its narrative.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">First released in 2004, <em>KotOR 2</em> only had a year of development time, which resulted in a ton of cut content and technical issues compared to its relatively stable predecessor.

So it’s hard to get too mad about Aspyr’s just-released Nintendo Switch port for being a buggy mess.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Switch port will randomly crash for no apparent reason, or loop a scene repeatedly until I give up and reset the game in hopes it won’t loop next time. Such problems would give plenty of cause to walk away from most Switch games, but as a seasoned <em>KotOR 2</em> player I’ve come to expect these bugs as the cost of admission to Obsidian’s obtuse, messy, and broken galaxy. Even so, it feels a bit egregious that it took two weeks for Aspyr to <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/kotor-2-gamebreaking-bug-aspyr-crash-onderon-1849136189\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/kotor-2-gamebreaking-bug-aspyr-crash-onderon-1849136189\">fix a game-breaking bug</a></span> that <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/kotor-ii-star-wars-aspyr-nintendo-switch-bug-the-sith-l-1849085914\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/kotor-ii-star-wars-aspyr-nintendo-switch-bug-the-sith-l-1849085914\">prevented players from being able to even complete the game</a></span>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I discovered the Switch port’s best feature by accident: By pressing the left movement stick twice, you can bring up the cheats menu. Here, you can manually add skills, replicate items, jump to certain cutscenes, or zoom around in the free camera view. I found that this was an excellent compromise between staying faithful to the original game and trying to offer a less frustratingly buggy experience. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"3b0c486a7605fb401b5d8c7b56f0a9ee\" data-recommend-id=\"image://3b0c486a7605fb401b5d8c7b56f0a9ee\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Jedi fights multiple soldiers with a lightsaber.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"3b0c486a7605fb401b5d8c7b56f0a9ee\" data-recommend-id=\"image://3b0c486a7605fb401b5d8c7b56f0a9ee\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Jedi fights multiple soldiers with a lightsaber.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The free camera is by far one of my favorite features: I explored the entirety of Onderon’s royal palace and found that the entire level was hovering in midair. Some games are content to merely poke fun at themselves. The Switch port of <em>KotOR 2</em> fully owns up to its warts, and invites you to explore them at your leisure. Aspyr’s port also restores certain story scenes that were cut from the original, but it was hard for me to remember which ones they were, since I always played the PC version with the content restoration mod. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Switch port crashes less frequently than the PC version, but you’re not playing this game to experience technical excellence, or to monotonously traverse its sparsely populated environments. You’re playing it because <em>KotOR 2</em>’s cynical, questioning perspective of the galaxy is what we need in an era when all our institutions are falling apart. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">BioWare’s original <em>KotOR</em> has a former Sith Lord save the Republic after initially conspiring to destroy it. In Obsidian’s sequel, a Jedi “Exile” excavates the remnants of a failed war, a failed government, and a failed spiritual philosophy. <em>KotOR 2</em> is much less encouraging about saving the Republic. Crucially, it does not ask you to feel any loyalty toward the galactic federation or the Jedi Order. What do you owe a government that turned you into a weapon? Absolutely nothing. But you can take up your laser sword for your own sake, and you can teach others to do the same.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game excels by telling multiple stories from the past and the present at once. The best example of this is the Peragus tutorial level, in which the player escapes from a mining facility. An assassin trapped me on the asteroid belt, forcing me to piece together video recordings to learn about his other, murdered victims and potential escape routes; all of that was part of a larger plot orchestrated by a droid’s attempts to “fix” the broken Republic. When I was investigating the ruins of the Sith planet of Korriban, I wasn’t just trying to find a Jedi master in hiding, but also relitigating the protagonist’s role in the brutal Mandalorian Wars, which took place before the<em> KotOR</em> series even began. And I felt terror when I went to investigate some strange signals on the smuggler’s moon of Nar Shadaa, only to find, upon returning, the severed limb of my questgiver. There were no clean answers, except for the ones that I inferred from context clues. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Like any good horror game, <em>KotOR 2</em> thrives on making you feel isolated and uncomfortable. Unfortunately, not every instance of philosophical inquiry sticks the landing. One such misstep occurred when I decided to give money to a beggar on Nar Shaddaa. Instead of responding like a normal person, your mentor says that you’ve weakened him by showing charity. This by itself would have been fine, except the game then showed me a vision of the man being beaten up for his loose change. I laughed at the scene, which came off more hamfisted than thoughtful. <em>KotOR 2 </em>can feel radical and liberating, but those moments coexist with ones like Nar Shaddaa’s, in which the game reproduces the cold, conservative logic of a dying empire. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>KotOR 2</em> isn’t a happy RPG in which everything can be resolved by the power of friendship. The characters reproduce the broken logic of a galaxy that has utterly failed them, and the game is ruthless about letting them fall. Years later, female developers alleged that lead writer and designer Chris Avellone <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/multiple-women-accuse-games-writer-chris-avellone-of-se-1844135498\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/multiple-women-accuse-games-writer-chris-avellone-of-se-1844135498\">had committed sexual misconduct</a></span> while he worked at Obsidian, to which he responded by <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/games-writer-chris-avellone-files-libel-lawsuit-denies-1847186019\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/games-writer-chris-avellone-files-libel-lawsuit-denies-1847186019\">suing them for libel</a></span>. Avellone was not the only writer on the team, but it was nevertheless difficult for me to separate the art from <em>KotOR 2</em>’s lead designer. The game portrays the galaxy in shades of gray, which made the game feel liberating to play as a troubled college student. Now, as a more experienced adult, I’m far more critical of how <em>KotOR 2 </em>represents moral ambiguity, which can often be weaponized to serve men in power. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Nevertheless, the game always hits hard emotionally in a way that no other <em>Star Wars</em> media ever has. My favorite moment occurs near the end, when <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v416Ri38O7g\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v416Ri38O7g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your protagonist finally meets the Jedi masters</a></span> who had exiled them from the order. The background music completely fades when the Exile’s mentors explain why they lost their connection to the Force, but it resumes triumphantly when they start condemning their student’s existence as a danger to the galaxy. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“You were blinded,” accuses the master. In response, the camera abruptly cuts to the Sith Lord Traya, who’s been lurking nearby: “And at last, you saw.” Though these lines aren’t as flowery as most of the script’s, the dramatic irony of the execution lands hard and makes this long-anticipated Dantooine encounter the most memorable scene in the game. </p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords \" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While <em>KotOR 2</em> almost never takes a specific stance on the extreme perspectives of its traumatized cast, the cinematic techniques it deploys on Dantooine make it clear that the Jedi’s teachings about detaching themselves from worldly concerns are wrong. But the Jedi masters hit the mark with one of their accusations—by slaughtering hundreds of faceless enemies and soaking up all the experience points, your character has indeed become the deadliest, most unaccountable rogue in the galaxy. I admired that <em>KotOR 2 </em>not only acknowledges that RPG mechanic in-game, but is willing to let a character willing to speak to why BioWare protagonists are, on the whole, bad for the galaxy.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite your Jedi Exile being the most proficient of killers, <em>KotOR 2</em> is also able to take away their agency by having their mentor manipulate events from behind the scenes. The Switch port retains the scenes in which Darth Traya forcibly manipulates several characters to aid in the protagonist’s quest, all without their knowledge. Traya’s hatred for the Force stems from how the mystical phenomenon actively manipulated history, and yet she regularly uses it to dominate others. Watching her blackmail my friends while the Exile was out of earshot felt horrific. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Yet I also loved that these events fell entirely out of the protagonist’s knowledge or control. In BioWare games the player is typically all-powerful. Given enough time, the “chosen one” protags always become privy to the world’s darkest, most gruesome secrets. But in <em>KotOR 2</em>, your forlorn Exile lacks the galaxy’s mandate. When you’re truly an everyman, you’re subject to being controlled by systems and people more powerful than you. It was fascinating to be privy to information about the Exile that was completely separate from the protagonist’s own awareness. <em>KotOR 2</em> is a sequel to BioWare’s critically acclaimed <em>Star Wars</em> game, but subverts that studio’s protagonist-centric approach to storytelling. There are some secrets that the Jedi Exile will never find out, and that’s not an injustice. That’s just the reality of life. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Near the end of the game, I had a private conversation with one of my party members, Disciple. He was a former Jedi trainee who metaphorically worshiped the Exile. My character opened up about how guilty they felt about leading others into a galactic space war, and expressed doubts as to whether the party members had followed of their own free will. Disciple didn’t wholly convince me that he was totally unaffected by the Exile’s Force sensitivity, but in 2004 it felt transgressive for <em>KotOR 2</em> to interrogate the ethics of RPG protagonism. It still feels relevant in 2022, when even the most ambitious, story-rich games can’t seem to avoid centering themselves around the player. What a very important person they must be.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Review: Knights of the Old Republic 2 On Switch Is A Buggy, Brilliant Triumph In RPGs', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/ec7ff2757e0e6456a91a3f55179691d5.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/star-wars-kotor-2-obsidian-nintendo-switch-1849318853', 'Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords is a horror story.

While previous titles amounted to breezy <em>Kirby </em>visual novels, <em>Forgotten Land </em>is a Greek epic chocked full of imposing titans Kirby must conquer, and gone are the on-the-rails tours through picturesque side-scrolling landscapes where you overcome enemies with the power of friendship and Kirby’s bottomless lung capacity. Now, you must boldly march into the unknown armed as the throat goat while investing time and resources into upgrading powers of your choosing.

There are Treasure Hunt time trials for platforming fans, collaborative play for those who don’t want to go it alone, and of course, the optional open-world objectives that will make a completionist’s heart sing.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All of these elements can help in your mission, whether that’s in the form of upgrades, a helping hand in fights, or acquiring new loot. But <em>Forgotten Land </em>never forces you to delve into these playstyles, leaving you to make the game your own.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"1d77c10b52a5978fc46cf99d3624371e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1d77c10b52a5978fc46cf99d3624371e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kirby knocks back a mole rat after erupting from the ground with a drill strapped to his head.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"1d77c10b52a5978fc46cf99d3624371e\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1d77c10b52a5978fc46cf99d3624371e\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kirby knocks back a mole rat after erupting from the ground with a drill strapped to his head.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game entices you to at least try exploring the different objectives, though, with a smart use of cues at the start of levels. Players are prompted with messages like, “There are five objectives you can complete,” which encouraged me to scour every crack in the wall or mysteriously-Kirby-shaped anomaly for a hidden pathway or mysterious item.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While <em>Kirby </em>games aren’t known for their difficulty, <em>Forgotten Land </em>adds a sense of nuance to traversal and combat. After completing an area, the game reveals objectives that you missed like finding a secret pathway or defeating a boss with a specific power without being hit or floating off the ground. Though you can mainline the game by blitzing through areas like skipping through a board game, the game’s optional objectives transform into a checklist that encourages more thorough exploration of the game’s 3D world and mastery of Kirby’s abilities. But the game more heavy-handedly encourages this growth through its Treasure Hunt side quests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Though I initially dreaded Treasure Hunts for dropping me into an obstacle course devoid of the game’s many inventive worlds, they quickly became my favorite aspect of <em>Forgotten Land</em> for the challenge they presented when my<em> </em>brain-rotten <em>Devil May Cry-</em>esque swordsmanship<em> </em>made the first couple of worlds a cakewalk to get through. It also didn’t hurt that grinding through them allowed me to quickly level up my go-to Kirby powers.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Kirby And The Forgotten Land\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"kirby-and-the-forgotten-land\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That being said, <em>Forgotten Land </em>isn’t without its issues.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The platforming can be finicky. While a running start before jumping would usually give you more distance, <em>Kirby</em> interprets that input as you walking forward with no intention of jumping, leading Kirby to take the plunge into the unforgiving depths. Platforming <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no%20johns\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no%20johns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Johns</a></span> aside, you can rest assured that each stumble and stride during the trials and tribulations of Kirby are generously rewarded in <em>Forgotten Land</em>’s bombastic finale.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And while <em>Forgotten Land</em> is rich with hazardous landscapes and foreboding music, it is bereft of compelling new characters.

Prior to <em>Forgotten Land</em>, he was portrayed merely as a lazy, unjust king. But <em>Forgotten Land</em> breaks the mold by giving the old curmudgeon a chance for redemption in a stunning “Go ahead, I’ll hold them back” scene that could have been pulled straight from an action film.<em> </em>Subtle moments like Dedede’s chivalry or Kirby’s many bug-eyed surprised faces provide short-hand characterization and provide much-needed levity in between Kirby’s treacherous globetrotting. And he’s essentially the last vestige of humanity before bonkers space shit happens<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Finally,<em> Forgotten Land</em>’s final act is balls-to-the-walls high-octane action alongside some <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/kirby-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-hal-laboratory-cre-1848759736\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/kirby-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-hal-laboratory-cre-1848759736\">third-act smörgåsbord of elements</a></span> that evoked thoughts of <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film)\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Akira</em></a></span>, <em>Bayonetta, </em>and even <em>Halo 3</em>. While any other game’s attempt at such an overblown twist might buckle under the weight of its own ambition, <em>Forgotten Land</em>’s<em> </em>finale never did. Because Kirby is already an eldritch horror himself, everything within <em>Forgotten Land</em>’s bat-shit crazy ending felt like a slow boil of concepts the game drip-fed you until finally blowing its lid in spectacular fashion showcasing every gameplay mechanic at its maximum potential within the final act.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">From its rapture beginnings to its M.

Bodies and ghosts alike still pump through streets, subway stations, and the city’s other familiar arteries. They cross long-forgotten leylines, producing a new arcane geometry—all cell phones, nameless gods, and hungry demons. The God of this world may be dead, but the cities are not.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>series is the flagship franchise of Atlus, a Japanese publishing juggernaut. However, despite its cult following, impeccable gameplay, and unparalleled character design, the series has yet to firmly cement itself in the U.S. gaming consciousness. Instead, its spinoff series <em>Persona</em> has come to define many people’s idea of the modern JRPG. But even when overshadowed by the series it started, <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> remains defiantly strange—and <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> may be the series’ best game yet.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The franchise is known for its rewarding, expansive, and tough-as-nails combat, its terse, nuanced writing about faith, philosophy, and power, and some of the best (and most psychosexual) enemy designs in the entire medium. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> embodies every one of these aspects in spades, iterating upon and refining them while never demanding that a player be familiar with the games that came before it. I believe it can mark not only a turning point for the series’ narrative and thematic core, but for its place in the mainstream gaming canon.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All of this in spite of the dozens of hours I lost to its barebones save system.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> opens with an eight- to ten-hour trek through the desert, following a short introduction set in modern Tokyo. It is, much like all of the sand, incredibly abrasive. The tutorial lasts about two hours total, a fact I learned very well by repeating it almost four times because I kept forgetting to save after completing it—only to be absolutely ruined by a surprisingly difficult encounter. <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>does not have any auto-saving or checkpoints. My actual playtime is about 15 hours more than what the in-game clock tells me.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You play as a Nahobino, a fusion of human and demon that has the potential to grow into a god. Early on, <em>SMT V </em>establishes that the Abrahamic God, referred to as YHVH throughout most of the series, was just one of many truly divine beings, referred to as Nahobino, composed of equal parts Knowledge and Life. However, YHVH eventually stripped his fellow divinities of their Knowledge—which was then passed on to humans when we ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. YHVH then altered the laws of the universe to prevent the fusion of humans and demons, preventing any potential Nahobino from challenging Him.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f3b1b3fd2ec4173b5f9ef69ca277954f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f3b1b3fd2ec4173b5f9ef69ca277954f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Abdiel, one of God\'s angels, asks the player if they went against God\'s law.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f3b1b3fd2ec4173b5f9ef69ca277954f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f3b1b3fd2ec4173b5f9ef69ca277954f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Abdiel, one of God\'s angels, asks the player if they went against God\'s law.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In the second chapter of the book of Genesis, God creates two humans—Adam and Eve—who wander the Garden of Eden. They cannot die and their every need is satiated. There is, however, one rule. They cannot eat the fruit from a particular tree, which contains knowledge of good and evil. One day, Eve, after being convinced by a serpent, eats the fruit and both Adam and Eve are cast out of heaven and rendered mortal. Most people would tell you that she was tricked into eating the fruit—but I don’t think I would call what happens to Eve a trick.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The serpent’s core argument is simple and compelling. “God knows the truth of good and evil. Don’t you want to be closer to God?”<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I don’t know how you can fault her for wanting that.<br></p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After a few hours, the game reveals that God was petty and cruel and that he has been dead for 18 years. Then, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> asks you a difficult question: What do you do with the absent throne of creation?<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">To answer this question, you spend a lot of time fighting angels and demons alike using the series signature “Press-Turn” battle system, which it introduced in <em>SMT III: Nocturne.</em> It remains possibly the best turn-based combat system in the entire medium.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It is, on its face, pretty simple. Demons have elemental affinities—targeting their weaknesses or landing a critical hit grants an extra action and missing an attack or using an ability that a demon is immune to will take away two actions. The same rules apply to both you and the demons you face.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Shin Megami Tensei V\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"shin-megami-tensei-v\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You and your three demonic companions, which you can recruit through a mix of conversation trees and gifts during any random encounter or fuse from those who have already joined you, begin every turn with one action. This means that any given turn can have between one and eight total actions if you repeatedly crit or hit an enemy’s weakness. If that sounds like a lot, it is. However, you often need all eight of those actions to survive the game’s brutal encounters. The battle system works both ways, after all.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>series has a reputation for its astonishingly difficult, “unfair” boss fights—this reputation is both inaccurate and well deserved. But of course it is difficult; you are fighting cast-off, lonely, and broken gods, after all. You are challenging the bones of the world itself.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Encounters can be incredibly difficult—even the assorted enemies wandering the game’s overworld can wipe your party if you aren’t paying attention—but they are rarely unfair, on account of the massive toolkit the series gives you access to.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Defeating a <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> boss usually isn’t a matter of execution but planning, which is why the series can appear unfair to new players. Your first attempt at a boss, unless you’re extremely lucky or clairvoyant, will not go well. They will have unreasonably powerful attacks, you won’t know their weaknesses, and they will likely outlevel you. Grinding will not solve this problem either—unless you manage to significantly outlevel a boss (10 levels or more) you will still get your ass kicked if you go into a fight unprepared. This is where the series’ signature Fusion system comes in handy.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You acquire almost every demon in the game in one of two ways (excluding some demons who join you after quests): negotiation and fusion. Negotiating with demons requires you to convince them to join your party through a mix of conversation and bribery. These demons will be standard and pretty underwhelming. Fighting a boss with a negotiated demon will not go well unless you’ve sunk a lot of time into leveling them up and they’re a natural fit for that particular boss, which is extremely rare. Fused demons, on the other hand, are much more reliable.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"865edaaf5012852e715a41b1ade506d0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://865edaaf5012852e715a41b1ade506d0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot of the game\'s fusion system, depicting the demon Mada being fused.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"865edaaf5012852e715a41b1ade506d0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://865edaaf5012852e715a41b1ade506d0\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot of the game\'s fusion system, depicting the demon Mada being fused.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">By sacrificing two (or sometimes more) demons at the Cathedral of Shadows, you can summon a new, more powerful demon. The resultant demon can retain some of its predecessor’s skills, stats, and experience points. The list of fusible demons will always be longer than the ones available to you via negotiation in any given area. This allows you to fuse demons with the exact skills and affinities to best handle a given boss fight.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> doesn’t just ask you to use its fusion system though, it demands that you abuse it. For example, fusion has a handful of rules—the most frequently invoked of which is that you cannot fuse a demon with a higher level than your player character. This rule is designed to prevent you from fusing outrageously powerful demons in the early game. However, there are ways to subvert this rule. You can pass stats and experience points down through the fusion system, which means that you can artificially increase the power of a given demon. Sure, you can fuse a normal Level 44 Black Frost with 40 Strength, it’ll do all right in combat; or, you can use pre-leveled demons with boosted stats to get a Level 47 Black Frost with 50 Strength, an unreal set of passive skills, and no weaknesses to absolutely shred a boss.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When you go from getting absolutely rolled by a boss, to obliterating them with a team of highly specialized demonic weirdos, it is incredibly satisfying. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>believes the only way to beat a god is to build a better one.<br></p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Washing Away of Wrongs</em> is a contemporary art installation formerly on view at the Cleveland Art Museum. The piece is composed of two sealed dryers, each of which contains an aromatic. The smells are designed to evoke an intense emotion in the audience. I have visited the exhibit three times with three different groups of people and I haven’t seen it fail once.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The first dryer is nostalgic and gentle. The second makes people weep. It is wet, earthy, and rotten. It does not sting the nose. The tears are not a physiological response. I wonder what could’ve happened, what tragedy was so great as to stain our generational memory—what could bring me to tears, thousands of years removed from the violence. I often wonder if this is what a dead god smells like.</p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f1124c24467bde00c3fc33b555316da1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f1124c24467bde00c3fc33b555316da1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Aogami, the proto-Fiend of Bethel who the protagonist fuses with to become the Nahobino, offers his hand to the camera.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f1124c24467bde00c3fc33b555316da1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f1124c24467bde00c3fc33b555316da1\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Aogami, the proto-Fiend of Bethel who the protagonist fuses with to become the Nahobino, offers his hand to the camera.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In addition to the fusion system, you’ll also rely on Miracles and Apotheosis to give you an edge in combat. With the throne of God empty, your status as a Nahobino gives you the power to alter both demons and the laws of reality itself.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>SMT V </em>introduces essences, which are effectively the raw skills and affinities of a given demon in item form. The essence of Power, for example, is weak to Dark attacks, immune to Light Attacks, and has a variety of Light-based skills. Through Apotheosis, you can grant these skills to any demon regardless of how they were fused. This opens up demon customization in a really exciting way. Combining Apotheosis and Fusion can allow you to make some absolutely unreal demons.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Additionally, the Nahobino has the unique ability to take on the affinities of any demon. If you’re struggling with a particularly hard boss, you can just grant the Nahobino an immunity to its most powerful attacks. It is a really welcome addition to the series that allows for you to be a lot more fluid with the skillsets of your demons.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Miracles are passive abilities which you can purchase with Glory, a resource you find scattered throughout the game’s environment. Miracles cover the basics like how many skills your demons have, how much items cost in the store, and what attack types your Nahobino is best at using, but also allow you to modify more fundamental mechanics like how demons pass down experience points, what generates Magatsuhi (a resource which allows for extremely powerful Omagotoki skills), and so much more. It is a great expansion of the App system introduced by<em> SMT IV</em> and <em>SMT IV Apocalypse</em>.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This isn’t the only way <em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>builds on its predecessors though. The game is a thematic and narrative successor to <em>SMT IV Apocalypse</em>, which (spoilers) ends with you killing the Abrahamic God, but feels like a spiritual successor to <em>SMT III: Nocturne</em>. The Nahobino resembles <em>Nocturne</em>’s Demi-fiend, and most of the game takes place in a blighted, apocalyptic version of Tokyo that has been rendered almost unrecognizable and contains very few humans. Both games are decidedly lonely. However, I think that <em>SMT V </em>manages to pull off this lonely atmosphere much better through its use of contrast.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>SMT V</em> takes place in two different Tokyos: contemporary Tokyo and post-apocalyptic Tokyo. This allows the game to have its lonely cake and eat it too. By having more human interaction and character motivations in contemporary Tokyo, the strangeness and cruelty of apocalyptic Tokyo feels so much more significant. Your character, as a fusion of human and demon (similarly to the Demi-fiend), is an embodiment of both worlds, and the game uses this to great effect narratively and thematically.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">However, in attempting to fuse two Tokyos, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> underprioritizes its human heart. In the game’s first major “you’re no longer just wandering a desert” plot beat, <em>SMT V</em> tries to tell a story about bullying. There is a girl who is bullied. You’re close with her friend who is worried about her. The bullied girl is, unsurprisingly, possessed by a demon, and then all hell breaks loose.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"1b163bc7d43357fc238e3043cde79a68\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1b163bc7d43357fc238e3043cde79a68\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Dazai, one of the game\'s primary human NPCs, is filmed by his friend before entering a tunnel.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"1b163bc7d43357fc238e3043cde79a68\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1b163bc7d43357fc238e3043cde79a68\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Dazai, one of the game\'s primary human NPCs, is filmed by his friend before entering a tunnel.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There were several moments throughout this arc that I knew were supposed to affect me. Desperate pleas, tearful confessions, and tragic deaths were everywhere, but they lacked emotional weight. The moments themselves are well executed upon—the camera holds perfectly on pierced ribs, slow falls, and pathetic cruelty, and the music hits just right. The problem is that you’ve known these characters for all of 30 minutes. In comparison to the eight to ten hours you’ll spend on your first journey into the Netherworld, the setup for the game’s first major arc only lasts between 30 minutes and an hour depending on your reading and listening speed.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>SMT V</em>’s pace rapidly oscillates from breakneck to glacial, and the experience can be deeply disorienting at times. I wish the game had given me more time early on to shift between the demon and human worlds, to see how one touches the other. Instead it just uses underdeveloped tragedy to send you on its next quest.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And yet despite all of that, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-vs-demons-are-cheeky-little-bastards-1848092492\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-vs-demons-are-cheeky-little-bastards-1848092492\">I cannot help but love this game’s writing</a></span>. While the human characters can feel like quick caricatures, some of the demons you encounter are given the time and space to have some really great moments—particularly former gods, whose closeness to humans gives them just enough relatability for the divine horrors which befall them to work.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I mentioned previously that <em>SMT V</em>’s other divinities had been stripped of their godhood by YHVH, which creates some great story moments for fallen and falling gods. In the first part of a major side-quest line relating to the Egyptian gods, Isis asks you to hunt and kill a corrupted version of her own son in the hopes that he can be reborn sane. She shows genuine care for him, and the Egyptian god’s recurrence throughout the story lets you get to know them.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Demons are also given the chance to have much bigger personalities than their human counterparts. Most human NPCs are pretty subdued or clearly fall into a genre staple archetype. There’s the coward who wants to fight, there’s the cool older dude who is impressed by your developing skills, and there’s your gentle but firm commander. All of these characters are executed upon well, but they’re a bit paint-by-numbers. The demons, however, are a bunch of wacky weirdos and I love every one of them.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Demons are, without fail, big swings. They are funny, sad, and deeply erratic, and it works so well for the game’s tone. From your negotiations with demons to your interactions with the game’s scattered NPCs, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> is consistently weird, which I am deeply grateful for. And when demons aren’t shitposting at you, they’ll probably be shouting philosophy in your general direction. This could be cringey but, luckily, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> actually has interesting things to say about identity, selfhood, and power.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"821d22205dcf72bdb68e0ec2baf4870c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://821d22205dcf72bdb68e0ec2baf4870c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The Nahobino summons a massive wave to crush the enemy.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"821d22205dcf72bdb68e0ec2baf4870c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://821d22205dcf72bdb68e0ec2baf4870c\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"The Nahobino summons a massive wave to crush the enemy.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>games have always been about power—how it is wielded, and how it is structured. The battle between the frequently libertarian forces of Chaos and the monstrously authoritarian forces of Law have always been the heart of the series. However, unlike previous games, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> takes place after the battle has ended.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> understands, better than previous games, that systems outlive the people who build them. The God of Order is dead and in spite of this his army still stands—they still wage their doomed war. They cannot even admit that he’s dead.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Starting after the battle has ended allows <em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>to more directly answer the question posed by every other game in the series: What comes after the revolution?<br></p>\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Oven of Aknhai is a story from the Talmud set in the second century CE. In it, a group of rabbis debate the application of a particular law from the Torah to a new type of oven. One rabbi argues that the new oven is ritually pure, the others disagree. When he becomes frustrated, the dissenting rabbi calls out to God to show proof that he is correct. In response, a tree leaps from the ground. The rabbi, rightfully, takes this as an indication of God’s will. When the other rabbis do not accept the argument, he continues to call on God to prove his position through miracles. Miracles happen without fail. Eventually, the voice of God himself calls down that the dissenting rabbi is correct. The other rabbis respond that the Torah is not in heaven. It was granted to human hands, for humans to interpret.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When God witnesses this he laughs and says “My children have triumphed over Me; My children have triumphed over Me.”<br></p>\n\n<hr class=\"sc-gcp5ez-1 khcaUW\">\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>, gods and demons alike are created by humanity’s belief in them. They are the products of the stories we tell. Gods, built by our own hands, shape our lives.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Systems, and stories, outlive the people who made them—they twist and writhe and change the lives of the people who follow. Sometimes they grow so big that they feel inevitable, ceaseless. They become unending cycles and wars without generals—they become mistaken for the laws of nature itself. The war between Law and Chaos was built to serve a function, to maintain order—that function has since become unnecessary. A violent and unjust world can be reimagined through the same tools that built it.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In the last two years, across the globe and in the U.S. in particular, we’ve seen people failed by their states time and time again in the wake of a global pandemic. Failed by the bigger-than-us things that we, supposedly, built to protect us. And when they failed, people didn’t. If 2020 and 2021 are remembered for anything but their death count, I hope it’s the mutual aid that kept that number from being so much higher. All the grocery deliveries, rent strikes, and protests that brought cities to their knees were organized by people, not systems.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> believes in humanity’s capacity to change the world around us—possibly more than any other game in the series. I just wish it had given its human characters more time to actually make that argument.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Shin Megami Tensei V: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/67827ef35f388b67f78b0c9f417f49d8.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-v-the-kotaku-review-1848102235', 'Shin Megami Tensei V takes place in two Tokyos—both are real, despite what the a...', NULL);

And it does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Happy Home Paradise</em> focuses on the designing aspect of <em>Animal Crossing</em>, something that <em>New Horizons </em>did much better than any of its main game predecessors. That’s both an asset and a limitation for the DLC. The <em>Animal Crossing</em> community has certainly embraced the decoration features, as evidenced by the massive number of island tours or custom designs highlighted on social media. But it also means that it offers very little if anything to those who aren’t into decorating.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But I am, so I’m here to tell all you other virtual designers that <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> does the job. It’s very well-executed, building on the features and general tone of <em>New Horizons</em>. You’ll “go to work,” as the game literally puts it and solicit clients who will paint a picture of the vision they have for their dream vacation home. You then get to choose the location and can set the scene with the season and time of day of your choice. From there, you decorate the interior and exterior, with only a few required items to check off but are mainly left to your own imagination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The best clients are highly specific. Like Sprinkle, a penguin who wanted a “Castle of Cold.” Naturally, I put her in an icy spot in the middle of winter, decked out her space with ice sculptures, and polished it to bits to give the ice some extra sparkle. The polishing mechanic even gets an upgrade where you can add new effects to furniture items like a chilly puff of condensation. You can bet I’ll be back to Sprinkle’s icy abode to add that in.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9c53448c2ee74fdfda0acdeff39f17ca\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9c53448c2ee74fdfda0acdeff39f17ca\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot of character Sprinkle in her Castle of Cold, an assignment in the Happy Home Paradise DLC.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9c53448c2ee74fdfda0acdeff39f17ca\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9c53448c2ee74fdfda0acdeff39f17ca\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot of character Sprinkle in her Castle of Cold, an assignment in the Happy Home Paradise DLC.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s a slow burn, meaning that, much like the rest of the game, you can’t unlock everything at once. Rather than feeling frustrating, the doling out of new material makes you feel like you’re growing in this new role or at least barred from marathoning the new content until you lose interest. While you work your way up with promotion and raises (we love fair compensation), you’ll also start unlocking more features. You can shine furniture to add new effects, change room sizes, build partition walls, and even design facilities like a school in addition to vacation homes. Plus, the items you unlock with each new design are saved for use in the future, giving you more possibilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Often as I played along in the main game, I found myself intrigued by certain objects but knew I would never use them. I liked seeing others make themed rooms online or set up sections of their islands as gas stations or cityscapes. But it didn’t feel like me. And I wasn’t going to change how I wanted my island or home to look just because those items were there. But <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> forces you to look beyond your own aesthetics by giving your prompts unique to each villager. It was more exhilarating even to try out something I would never do in my own home. And the challenges that did suit my style were equally rewarding because I got to play with a host of items, whether they were in my catalog or not and change their swatches at my will. It sparked so much inspiration and let me know what things I should take to Cyrus on Harv’s Island for a makeover.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">However, what I liked most about playing through <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> was that I never felt like I was set up to fail. Yes, I got more features to spruce things up as I progressed, but that didn’t stop me from feeling like I did well on my first go around. You’re always given what you need to succeed, and the option to go back and change things up later is freeing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Though I was somewhat put off by the lack of a solid grading system, I increasingly realized how much more uninhibited I felt actually playing the game. It seems you would have to purposefully try to have a bad outcome where a villager doesn’t like your design, so I was often left wondering whether I was actually doing a good job or if the game was just super easy. But when I was actually playing and designing and creating, I was unafraid to dip into pieces that weren’t in the “order” section, which is basically a list of recommended items. I also didn’t feel pressured to use all the tacked-on features if they didn’t feel suited to the space I was making.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Those features, the partition walls, soundscapes, and polishing, also make their way into the main game, both when working on your home and in Photopia (a photo studio on Harv’s Island). And if you’re already the type of player who likes to get creative with their home, this alone makes <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> more than worth it. You can’t, however, change room sizes in your own home or in Photopia. Still, the possibilities between the <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> features and the 2.0 update, breathe so much new life into the game.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"2d8697b381697e57f9f9901ceddbe162\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2d8697b381697e57f9f9901ceddbe162\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot from Nintendo Happy Home Paradise DLC for Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"2d8697b381697e57f9f9901ceddbe162\" data-recommend-id=\"image://2d8697b381697e57f9f9901ceddbe162\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot from Nintendo Happy Home Paradise DLC for Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are also DIY recipes to find along the shores of the island you visit to build a new home, as well as vines and glowing moss, which can be found on certain island tours Kapp’n takes you on in the latest update. You’re also paid in Poki, a unique currency to<em> Happy Home Paradise</em> and its archipelago. With it, you can buy rare furniture in the office showroom, and the selection changes every day. I would always work enough jobs to buy up the stock, whether I actually wanted the items or not. If I thought I could use the piece in my home, great. If not, it was an easy sell back to the Nooks. You can also buy items on credit eventually if you’re short on Poki because <em>Animal Crossing</em> just loves saddling its players with debt for some reason.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I try not to go into games of DLC with high expectations, lest those hopes be dashed. And <em>Happy Home Designer</em>, the spiritual predecessor to this expansion that also inspired many of the design mechanics that came with <em>New Horizons</em> at launch, seemed well-enough received. But the Nintendo 3DS side game seemed largely ignored. But <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> rose to the occasion, especially for a design-loving player like me.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If interior, or even exterior, designing is not your thing at all, this is an easy skip. But for nearly all other players, I would easily recommend picking <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> <br></p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Animal Crossing\'s Happy Home DLC Isn\'t Just Worth Buying, It\'s A Must-Play', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/cd3bd749dfd9d89bdeab4b0087241490.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/animal-crossings-happy-home-dlc-isnt-just-worth-buying-1848015955', 'As the first and only paid DLC, Animal Crossing: New Horizons’s Happy Home Parad...', NULL);

If a game is genuinely going to conjure a sense of dread, as <em>Metroid Dread</em>’s title seems to promise, I think it needs to be thorny and aggressive and hostile in ways I wasn’t convinced the Nintendo of 2021 could deliver. Boy, was I wrong to doubt: <em>Metroid Dread</em> is a game with conviction. It is committed to its efforts to put you on edge, to deny you a feeling of sheer domination over your adversaries and your environment, and for that, I applaud it. However, it also lacks the immersive, atmospheric pull of the most beloved <em>Metroid </em>games. The result is a somewhat cold game that possesses a raw technical prowess I intellectually admire, but not the <em>Metroid </em>magic it needed to win over my heart.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As <em>Dread</em> begins the Galactic Federation dispatches intergalactic bounty hunter Samus Aran to the uncharted planet ZDR. The heavily armored E.M.M.I. androids that preceded her have gone silent, but the strange world may hold clues about the virulent X parasite. Samus being immune, she’s the natural choice for such a dangerous mission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/hands-on-metroid-dreads-first-hour-is-legit-kinda-terr-1847742944\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/hands-on-metroid-dreads-first-hour-is-legit-kinda-terr-1847742944\">As I wrote</a></span> after playing about an hour of the game, <em>Dread</em>’s beginning is wonderfully destabilizing. You promptly find yourself stranded deep in the cavernous innards of ZDR, stripped of your powers after getting your ass handed to you by a mysterious Chozo warrior. As you communicate with your ship’s computer Adam, your mission is framed less as “Deal with the threat on ZDR like the badass bounty hunter you are” and more “Just stay alive and make it back to your ship so we can get the hell out of here.” It’s a narrative setup that sets the right tone: You don’t have the upper hand here, not by a longshot. In fact, you’re in peril.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"5cd6c258dd9948f40337c54678a3b836\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5cd6c258dd9948f40337c54678a3b836\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A damaged E.M.M.I., with Samus\' blaster arm pointed at it in the foreground.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"5cd6c258dd9948f40337c54678a3b836\" data-recommend-id=\"image://5cd6c258dd9948f40337c54678a3b836\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A damaged E.M.M.I., with Samus\' blaster arm pointed at it in the foreground.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That setup wouldn’t have much weight, though, if the gameplay didn’t back it up. It does, as relentlessly and remorselessly as the E.M.M.I. themselves, which have been transformed by some corrupting force into Terminators who will stop at nothing to capture Samus. Scattered across ZDR, the seven robots each patrol their own zone, and when Samus enters their turf, the tense game of cat and mouse begins. Your weapons are powerless to stop them. They hunt you with speed and agility and cold precision, their movements simultaneously graceful and unsettling. If caught, you have one chance to perform a counter that stuns the robot and enables you to escape, but it’s very tough to get the timing right. Fail the counter, and it’s game over. Thankfully, when you’re captured (and you will be, many times), the game shows some mercy and puts you right outside the door to the E.M.M.I. zone so you can give it another shot.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This could have been a recipe for tiresome, trial-and-error gameplay, but in <em>Dread</em>, it never becomes that. The E.M.M.I. feel alive and varied enough in their responses to your behavior that eluding them isn’t just a simple case of gaming the AI, and usually, when I was caught, I could see where I’d gone wrong, how I’d let myself be cornered rather than using the environment and my powers, such as a temporary cloaking ability, to my advantage. Because the E.M.M.I. are such formidable foes, the doors into their zones always filled me with a feeling of dr...let’s say apprehension...and I sometimes took a deep breath or two before venturing in to face them.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"80f78b2ba2e1f4dfd6711a3ce797c695\" data-recommend-id=\"image://80f78b2ba2e1f4dfd6711a3ce797c695\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus runs to the left through an earthy interior with plant life in the background and a pool of water above.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"80f78b2ba2e1f4dfd6711a3ce797c695\" data-recommend-id=\"image://80f78b2ba2e1f4dfd6711a3ce797c695\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus runs to the left through an earthy interior with plant life in the background and a pool of water above.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game’s not all running for your life, however. You are still Samus Aran, the greatest bounty hunter the galaxy has ever seen, and naturally, you eventually turn the tables on each E.M.M.I. First, you must find and defeat a living computer (called a central unit) in each of their zones. These giant brains with eyeballs are a nice bit of worldbuilding, clearly part of the same lineage that gave birth to series villain Mother Brain, though the connection, refreshingly, is never explicitly spelled out.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Harvesting the power of the defeated central units, you temporarily gain a blast so powerful, even the E.M.M.I. are vulnerable to it. Even then, however, defeating them remains a tense affair. You can only charge and fire these blasts while stationary, so you have to create space between you and your quarry and blast away at them while they approach you, praying that you’ve given yourself enough room to finish the job before they close the distance and end you once again. I exhaled with relief every time I finally shut one down, knowing that I could now move through that area in relative safety.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It is <em>relative </em>safety, though, as the E.M.M.I. are hardly the only threat you face in <em>Dread</em>. Even the ordinary enemies patrolling the caves and tunnels pack a wallop. If you don’t keep an eye on your health, it’s easy to find yourself dying to an attack from some run-of-the-mill jobber. To keep your health up, you’re incentivized to defeat enemies by landing melee counters right when they attack and then blast them to bits, which causes them to give up far more health and missiles than they would otherwise. It’s clearly an effort to keep you more engaged in combat with regular enemies, but after years of games prompting me to counter enemy attacks right when I see a bright flash, I no longer find it very interesting. On the contrary, it made dealing with these foes feel like a rote, Pavlovian process: see flash, hit button, get reward.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Yet bosses are genuinely involving. You have to play carefully, learning their cues and avoiding their attacks, lest they make short work of you. Gone are the days when you could tank a boss with missile spam and a few energy tanks, killing them faster than they could kill you. Here, each extra tank lets you take just one or two more hits before death. <em>Dread</em>’s bosses are strict teachers: You learn or you die. This meant that, by the time I did learn a boss’ attacks well enough to win, I often did so near flawlessly, which was always a satisfying outcome after repeatedly getting destroyed.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The exacting demand of <em>Dread</em>’s boss battles sometimes goes too far, however. One particular late-game fight pits you against a multi-phase boss, and eventually I’d mastered the first two phases well enough to complete them every time but still struggled with the third. Every time I died, I had to spend minutes going through the motions of the first two phases again, just to get another shot at the nasty final form. After one too many cycles of that, I was tempted to smash my fancy OLED Switch to bits.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Metroid Dread\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"metroid-dread\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In some ways, being Samus Aran has never felt better. She moves with a speed and agility that are remarkable even by series standards, possesses a new slide that feels like a natural part of her moveset, and gains all the traditional powers that make conquering the best <em>Metroid </em>games so satisfying. Upgrades like the gravity suit, which lets you move through water as if it’s air, and the space jump, which lets you jump not just twice or three times but endlessly, are still so liberating, they almost feel like cheating. And yet, despite delivering all this tried-and-true satisfaction, <em>Dread </em>doesn’t rank as one of the most memorable games in the series.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That’s because the best <em>Metroid</em> games earn a lasting place in our memory not just by virtue of the joys of being Samus and gradually becoming more powerful, but through excellence in atmosphere, music, and an elegantly minimal approach to narrative. <em>Dread</em>’s visuals are by far the most advanced of any game in the series, and there is indeed something impressive about the way the camera sometimes seamlessly swoops in to show off just how good Samus looks up close. But there’s also something a bit sterile about the look of this game. <em>Super Metroid</em>’s environments have a <em>mood</em>. You feel something in the dim blue lighting of the space station, the eerie stillness of the wrecked ship. <em>Dread</em>’s environments, for all their clean lines and hard edges, never pull you in the way those do.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Dread</em>’s music is similarly lacking something. It lingers in the background, commenting on the action but not really calling attention to itself. I think 2D <em>Metroid </em>games call for music you remember as part of the experience; sparse melodies that capture Samus’ isolation, and robust anthems that celebrate her intrepid heroism.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"6c0c0d8e36a9945486227ee45a6fcc30\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6c0c0d8e36a9945486227ee45a6fcc30\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus stands, head slightly bowed, her visor glowing a bright green.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"6c0c0d8e36a9945486227ee45a6fcc30\" data-recommend-id=\"image://6c0c0d8e36a9945486227ee45a6fcc30\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Samus stands, head slightly bowed, her visor glowing a bright green.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And then, there’s the story. <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://metroid.nintendo.com/news/metroid-dread-report-vol-1/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://metroid.nintendo.com/news/metroid-dread-report-vol-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to Nintendo</a></span>, <em>Dread “</em>marks the end of the story arc focusing on the strange, interconnected fates of Samus Aran and the Metroids.” I’ve been playing these games from the beginning of that saga, and I am underwhelmed by this conclusion. Without going into specific detail, it offers up a villain who feels out of left field, and who delivers a clunky lore dump of a monologue in a series best served by mystery and narrative simplicity. Samus does undergo some shifts toward the end of the game that feel exactly right, inevitable even, as the series hurtles toward its culmination, but that evolution of Samus as a character deserved a subtler, better story.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So here we are. Supposedly, the saga is complete, and I’m left with mixed feelings. I’m glad that <em>Dread </em>really goes for it, that it wants to make you feel hunted and disadvantaged and that it’s willing to feel hostile in order to accomplish that. The result is a feeling that survival itself is a reward more meaningful than all the upgrades in the world, a feeling I rarely get from games anymore. But ZDR never captivated me the way previous <em>Metroid </em>settings have, and as a conclusion to the story arc, <em>Dread </em>seems to misunderstand what made the early chapters resonate. Samus is wonderful, a survivor, an icon, and she endures. But when I think back on my time with her over the past several decades, <em>Dread </em>will forever dwell in the shadows of my favorite <em>Metroid </em>memories.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'Metroid Dread: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/9a3240496ae4089804a3c916f0080c79.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/metroid-dread-the-kotaku-review-1847823602', 'I admit I was skeptical.

Your grandmother is picking up a movie and she has no idea what it is yet, so you have time. There is a room with several hundred video games. You have a used Xbox 360, filled with the half-remembered save files of its previous owner, and a PS2 without a memory card. You pick a game called <em>Dark Souls</em>, for the Xbox 360, which your grandmother side-eyes, because while she doesn’t go to church, she does use angel cards to speak with Gabriel. You assuage her fears by reminding her that she really liked the movie <em>Hobo with a Shotgun</em>, so does she really have any room to talk?</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You go home and load a mid-game save (thanks, previous Xbox owner) only to be killed by snakes and rolling boulders.

They are an onslaught for the senses, constantly presenting you with new objectives and ways of interacting with the game.

You are always some variant of little guy in <em>WarioWare: Get It Together!</em> You will never be a pencil or a pair of scissors, just a cute lil dude trying to get things done. This could, at first, feel limiting for a series built around giving you wild control schemes, but the game makes it work by giving you around two dozen tiny friends, each of whom control differently from one another. Additionally, a lot of microgames have a different layout depending on your character. If you try to escape a building as 18-Volt, a character who can throw discs but can’t walk, the level will be populated with rings for you to grab onto, which means it plays very differently than it would for Cricket, the kid who can jump.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Characters are definitely built to be better at some games than others, as certain control schemes become wildly unwieldy in a lot of scenarios. However, there is a joy to this unwieldiness. Being handed a character whose abilities are a bad fit for the microgame at hand leads to a lot of dumb fun. Trying to turn a windmill as a character who can’t stop jumping is awkward! And that awkwardness is the point. The <em>WarioWare</em> games are a love letter to the medium, indulging in all the silliness it has to offer.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The thing I love about <em>Get It Together! </em>in particular is that it models the experience of learning games for the first time. As someone who has been doing this for too long, most of gaming’s verbs are familiar to me. I know that right moves you right and left moves you left. I’ve built the muscle memory necessary to play first-person shooters on both mouse and keyboard and controller. I’ve developed enough game literacy that most mechanics are intuited and internalized almost instantly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"\"><span class=\"clear-both flex-video video-315 widescreen\"><iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ir6oK58mXYM\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" class=\"lazyload\" scrolling=\"yes\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">By applying a bunch of different control schemes to the same objectives, <em>WarioWare: Get It Together! </em>let’s me relive the joy of learning how to move in a video game. I don’t have to relearn how to play every new action RPG once I’ve developed the prerequisite skillset, once I’ve learned <em>how</em> to learn. <em>WarioWare’s</em> microgames barely give you time to figure out your objectives, let alone what you’re doing with your hands. However, you still develop that literacy over time, which is a great feeling!<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I know how to move Ashley through a space, and how her abilities work. As I apply her skillset to more and more situations, I get better at understanding the design of both the games I’m using her for, and the character herself. Even when I don’t like how a particular character controls, the process of learning them is a fun exercise. And the variety allows me to better articulate what I like and why. I enjoy characters who can move in any direction. I enjoy characters with strange control schemes that allow them to do wacky stuff. I don’t like characters that auto-jump.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Playing <em>WarioWare</em> reminds me how, and why, I became a critic. It was by playing hundreds of games for two hours each, regardless of tone or genre. My grandmother, and her parallel love of movies, let me touch an entire Family Video’s worth of weird and messy art. My colleague John Walker recently asked if there’s any kind of video game I don’t play, and I told him no, there isn’t. Games I don’t like are still interesting, and still worth my time and energy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>WarioWare: Get It Together!</em> is all of my messy love for this stupid art form distilled into one totally solid microgame collection that would make a great party game, and I am grateful for the few hours I have spent with it.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'WarioWare: Get It Together!: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/6a18be9dd059ea3a2a35e20def55fa85.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/warioware-get-it-together-the-kotaku-review-1847652481', ' You are 12 years old and you are in the local Family Video.

It’s actually a rather cozy gig. You’re given a place to stay, top-of-the-line camera equipment, and an unlimited supply of fluffruit to throw at Pokémon to get their attention. You’re also given unlimited access to the NEO-ONE, a high-tech vehicle capable of teleportation and able to survive in the harshest of environments. You aren’t allowed to steer the NEO-ONE, only ride in it as it patrols set paths, giving every course in the game an amusement park ride feel. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"oobniunuac0qtna5s7ng\" data-recommend-id=\"image://oobniunuac0qtna5s7ng\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"oobniunuac0qtna5s7ng\" data-recommend-id=\"image://oobniunuac0qtna5s7ng\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Though developed by Bandai Namco Games, <em>New Pokémon Snap</em> is a Nintendo-published game, and early access to Nintendo games means there’s certain information I will not be able to impart over the course of this review. I can’t reveal the exact number of Pokémon in the game, the number of islands in the Lental region, or the number of photo-shooting courses and their variants. There are certain creatures I cannot mention, and aspects of the game’s story Nintendo would rather we keep under wraps until the game officially launches this Friday.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I understand the restrictions. As much as I would love to tell you... certain things about the game, it’ll be much more exciting for you to discover these things on your own.

More than 200 pocket monsters are waiting to be captured on film in <em>New Pokémon Snap</em>, spread across several colorful and varied biomes. Initially, you’re a passenger, a passive NEO-ONE rider who can only snap pictures until the ride comes to a complete stop. But soon you gain special tools that allow you to interact with the region’s fauna. Toss a fluffruit at a Pokémon to catch it eating a snack or shake it out of hiding. Play music to make Pokémon dance or sing. New to the series are Illumina Orbs, glowing spheres native to region that illicit all sorts of strange and magical responses from pocket monsters.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"New Pokémon Snap\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"new-pok-mon-snap\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Each ride in the NEO-ONE is a chance to uncover new Pokémon and hidden secrets, sort of like the action version of a hidden object game. The environments are filled to the brim with little details, layers upon layers of foliage thick with life. Depending on the tools you use and where your camera is pointed you can discover ancient ruins, explore alternate paths, and capture the coolest pictures of Pokémon possible. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"nfmi2pslrhefvcu5dkbe\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nfmi2pslrhefvcu5dkbe\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"nfmi2pslrhefvcu5dkbe\" data-recommend-id=\"image://nfmi2pslrhefvcu5dkbe\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Pictures like this stunning shot of Florges, captured by yours truly during a daytime run through the Florio Nature Park.  It could use some more pocket monsters, but the size is excellent. Florges is well-framed and looking directly at the camera. According to Professor Mirror’s grading system, the picture is worth 4,543 points. Those points are added to my Research Level for Florio Nature Park. Unlocking higher Research Levels changes up a course, adding new monsters and even more secrets to discover. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Note  that my Florges picture is rated three stars. Filling out your Lental Photodex isn’t just about grabbing the best shot. There are four star levels for each Pokémon, and each star level is rated bronze, silver, gold, or platinum. A shot from far off with the subject looking away from the camera might rate a single star, while capturing a critter in a perfectly centered rare pose earns four stars. While the urge to get the best possible photo is strong, sometimes you need to curb your virtual photography skills to grab something lower quality. The mechanic is a little counterintuitive, but it does wonders for replayability. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"psewzytbn59kwt393reh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://psewzytbn59kwt393reh\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"psewzytbn59kwt393reh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://psewzytbn59kwt393reh\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And this is <em>New Pokémon Snap</em>, so the photo fun doesn’t stop when the NEO-ONE ride is over. You can fiddle around with your captured snaps in several nifty ways. For example, once a course is over and your pictures have been graded, you’re given the option to re-snap pictures, adjusting focus and filters to make your pic the very best, like no one photograph ever was. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Also, you can do this. </p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"sc3doaaohqnm7thhjy7s\" data-recommend-id=\"image://sc3doaaohqnm7thhjy7s\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"sc3doaaohqnm7thhjy7s\" data-recommend-id=\"image://sc3doaaohqnm7thhjy7s\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Back in 1999 on the Nintendo 64, if we wanted to share <em>Pokémon Snap</em> photos we had to invited people over (gross) or have our cartridges stolen by ex-girlfriends (true story). Now we have the internet, which we can fill with be-stickered pictures of Pokémon until the cloud runs out of space, which will never happen because clouds are magical. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>New Pokémon Snap</em> is pretty magical as well. It takes the unique formula of the 1999 original and expands on it just enough to feel like a completely new adventure, without diluting the simple joy of riding and snapping photos of impossible creatures. </p>', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', '2024-01-10 17:02:01', 'New Pokémon Snap: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/znnlmmtujlgxdi8bgnar.jpg', 'switch', 'https://kotaku.com/new-pokemon-snap-the-kotaku-review-1846779223', 'After 21 years, gaming’s least violent on-rails shooter triumphantly returns to ...', NULL);

Like most open-world adventures, everything is designed to get you to explore what’s over the next hill or across that nearby river. The map is peppered with question marks, many of which surround towns and temples in which you meet allies and upgrade equipment. Helpful diversions like hot springs and fox dens have obvious environmental tells. The wind, a major contributor to the game’s overall aesthetic, literally guides you to objectives. But there’s a big difference between scouring a map to completion and actually having a good time, no matter how obsessive a person you may be.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The story opens with Japan on the brink of war. A small group of samurai have gathered on a Tsushima beachhead to repel an invading Mongol force led by Khotun Khan, a fictional descendant of Genghis and Kublai Khan. While the Mongols attacked Japan on multiple occasions, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> liberally combines various historical and cultural artifacts for an entirely new narrative. As was the case in the late 13th century, the samurai find themselves unprepared to deal with the invaders’ overwhelming military tactics and get almost completely annihilated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> puts you in control of Jin Sakai, one of the island’s last remaining samurai. A half-dead Jin is pulled from the battlefield by a wandering thief named Yuna, only to rush off in an attempt to free his captured uncle. Jin makes it his mission to save his home from the invaders, who have wasted no time in running roughshod over Tsushima as a prelude to their attack on the Japanese mainland. For the player, this translates to random battles throughout the countryside and liberating villages occupied by the Mongols, sometimes with Jin’s allies but mostly on your own.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"jspd5uzi8cqcupkvm1vj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jspd5uzi8cqcupkvm1vj\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2890\" data-height=\"1626\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"jspd5uzi8cqcupkvm1vj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jspd5uzi8cqcupkvm1vj\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2890\" data-height=\"1626\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Jin is a blank slate in the early hours of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, with only brief flashbacks to his time learning from his uncle as any indication of who he is under his gruff exterior. As an idealized image of the samurai warrior caste that existed in Japan at the time, he spends a lot of time worrying about the dichotomy of honor and shame. But it soon becomes abundantly clear that Jin must adopt new tactics, even those he views as “dishonorable,” to liberate Tsushima, adding a thin layer of internal strife to the more overt conflict against the Mongols.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">This aspect of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> gave me pause when developer Sucker Punch Productions showed off early previews. Samurai have been extensively mythologized in modern times, reimagining what was essentially the paramilitary arm of a system of feudal land ownership as noble, superhuman dispensers of justice. Before playing the game, I imagined this stereotypical concept would tie into some weird, <em>Mass Effect</em>-esque morality system by which the main character would vacillate between “honor” and “shame” depending on how he approached every situation.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Thankfully, that’s not the case, even if the game’s narrative tunnel-visions on the concept. There’s no penalty for approaching battles in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> stealthily, which Jin considers a violation of samurai code. You don’t get locked out of any skill trees or storylines depending on how you decide to fight. While Jin is forced to take a more stealthy approach for both tutorial and narrative reasons early on, there’s also nothing stopping you from proudly walking into an enemy encampment and challenging dozens of Mongols to a straight-up fight. Sure, the best approach will always be a mixture of traditional katana skills and more “underhanded” tools like smoke bombs and firecrackers, but the game never punishes you for living out your own personal version of <em>Seven Samurai</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">That enduring image of a lone warrior surrounded by foes becomes a neat gameplay mechanic in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. When approaching a group of enemies, Jin can call out to them with a challenge for one-on-one combat against their strongest fighter. Here, the game asks you to hold the Triangle button and keep a close eye on your opponent. When they make a move, that’s your cue to release the button, which causes Jin to unsheathe his sword and unleash a deadly, one-hit kill. By the end of the game, a combination of skills and armor made it so I could slice through five enemies in a row before actually starting a battle, which proved to be a boon for some of the more difficult dust-ups.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"bq519zrzw8m0jnae3zrl\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bq519zrzw8m0jnae3zrl\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"bq519zrzw8m0jnae3zrl\" data-recommend-id=\"image://bq519zrzw8m0jnae3zrl\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s swordplay is basic and engaging, a mixture of light and heavy attacks, parries, and dodges, tied to specific buttons or button combos. The combat system is very easy to grasp if you’ve played any recent video game, perhaps as a way to indicate, through gameplay, that Jin has been learning to fight with a katana since he was a child. As the game goes on, you learn various stances—combat styles that you can shift into at will—by observing and killing Mongol generals. Stances are meant to deal with different types of enemies: The stone stance, for instance, is better suited to taking down swordsmen, whereas the water stance’s flow of bludgeoning strikes is perfect for decimating shields. These stances, much like the rest of Jin’s repertoire, can be improved with skill points earned from defeating enemies and completing missions to unlock more combo strings and increase damage.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The “ghost” in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> refers to Jin’s transformation from a rigid samurai warrior into a guerrilla vigilante willing to do anything to save his home. Where a samurai might focus entirely on his katana and bow, the covert tactics Jin learns over the course of the campaign give him access to a multitude of more subtle weaponry. This starts out with some basic kunai, which can be thrown to break an opponent’s guard from a distance, but quickly expands to include tools like smoke bombs, explosives, and even wind chimes that draw enemies’ attention. Jin’s most important tool, however, is his tanto, a short blade that allows him to perform quick, violent assassinations from the shadows. It’s rare to enter a fight where you’re not vastly outnumbered, so it’s best to balance the scales as much as possible from the relative comfort of stealth. The only time where stealth really feels required is when the Mongols have taken hostages. If an enemy spots you, they’ll start to cut down prisoners unless you can stop them.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">These two aspects of Jin’s arsenal combine to make every battle in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> fluid, evolving affairs. While you might initially sneak into a Mongol encampment, one wrong move can turn the mission into an all-out brawl against the camp’s entire garrison. I usually found myself picking off high-priority targets like bruisers with medieval shotguns and explosive-throwing support troops with my bow before wading into battle, where smart usage of my stances were key to surviving. Eventually, the Mongols begin to employ the services of animals like hunting dogs and hawks, which can sniff you out or spot you from above. I never found myself tiring of the basic flow of combat, but I quickly got so strong that stealthy approaches were just a waste of time when there weren’t any hostages to protect. Why assassinate Mongols when I could just walk up, challenge them to a duel, and mop up the stragglers?</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Besides combat, much of the game is dedicated to exploring the island’s lush environments. Jin strides across vast fields of flowers, the muck and mire of swamplands, and even the icy northern reaches of Tsushima during his adventure. At one point, he dropped his hand to feel the foliage as I raced along on a horse, mimicking my exact desire in that moment. <em>Tsushima</em> also features a weather system that, while not offering much apart from rain storms and rolling fog, gives the beautiful scenery an additional coat of aesthetic flair. Over the course of the game, Jin can learn songs on his flute that change the weather at will, which doesn’t really mean anything mechanically but makes for a fun way to customize your experience.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> has an almost insatiable desire to remind you of its influences through its visuals. Each mission opens with a title card that draws inspiration from old samurai films. An optional black-and-white visual filter is literally named after legendary director Akira Kurosawa but imparts the game with none of the charm or humanity for which his films are known. Important duels are preceded by a lengthy, tension-building cutscene that ultimately functioned as a minute or so to check my phone while waiting for it to play out for the tenth time. Every attempt at infusing <em>Tsushima</em> with these cribbed details feels like a wink and a nudge for recognition rather than true homage.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> fills its expanses with multiple diversions. Tall, white flags indicate the presence of a bamboo strike mini-game, which asks you to quickly tap out increasingly difficult button sequences to increase Jin’s resolve meter. In combat, this meter allows you to heal, use special techniques like a series of devastating slashes that homes in on opponents, and even revive yourself. Hot springs can be found beneath trees with orange blossoms, giving Jin a chance to decompress and extending his health bar. Swarms of fireflies mean a fox den is nearby, the denizen of which will lead you to a special shrine that lets you carry more charms, accessories with bonuses that range from simple stat boosts to more interesting mechanics like regaining arrows on a headshot. While it’s fun to listen to Jin’s internal thoughts while at the hot spring and to pet the foxes after their guidance, I never found myself excited to see one of these landmarks on the horizon. They were merely there to complete for a reward, a far cry from the dynamic intensity of battle.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Ghost of Tsushima\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"ghost-of-tsushima\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Most of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s activities exist simply to reward you rather than offer any meaningful experience. The layer of Japanese aesthetics barely hides the fact that the world is just there to be mindlessly mined for resources. It feels very weird to save a peasant from a group of Mongol soldiers, only to have them turn around and reward Jin with whatever meager possessions they were able to hide away. The game also has no problem with allowing you to raid homesteads for materials like iron and leather, which can then be used to upgrade your gear. Jin is the head of his clan, an aristocratic warrior who never wanted for anything in his life. Why is he so eager to squeeze every last resource from the people he’s supposed to be protecting? Life was hard before the Mongols arrived, and now villages and farms are burning. Those supplies would be much more useful in attending to refugees rather than a man whose sole ambition is reinstating the power structure that enforced these hardships in the first place.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Jin isn’t sympathetic or interesting enough to care about. Any growth he shows over the course of the game deals entirely with his approach to warfare, rather than the imbalances within the society he seeks to protect or even his own responsibility for maintaining them. When a friend from his childhood betrays him, for instance, Jin does very little personal inventory about how he might have contributed to the turncoat’s view of the world, instead focusing on a quest for revenge that could have been entirely prevented with a little bit of compassion.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">The story’s saving grace involves the multi-part side missions that focus on Jin’s allies. Many of these missions follow a similar pattern that usually ends with just another battle, but the characters Jin recruits are so compelling and charming that it makes up for any predictable gameplay decisions. In one mission, Jin finds himself assisting an aging warrior named Lady Masako in finding the people who conspired to murder her entire family amidst the Mongol invasion. Her quest for revenge forces Jin to come to grips with his own anger, and at one point they even come to blows when he stops her from carrying out an arguably more justified form of the revenge he himself seeks against Khotun Khan. Another side mission sees Jin meeting an old archery mentor, Sensei Ishikawa, to help him find his star pupil. Ishikawa’s relationship with his student mirrors Jin’s own relationship with his uncle, giving Jin an outside perspective on his struggle between the honor taught to him by his family and what must be done to defeat the invaders.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ianjefo5rrcludku4da1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ianjefo5rrcludku4da1\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ianjefo5rrcludku4da1\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ianjefo5rrcludku4da1\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\">Despite (or perhaps because of) <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s reliance on combat to drive many of its set pieces, the game’s best mission requires almost no combat. At various points in the game, Jin learns of local legends that lead to great rewards, like a robe that improves your archery skills or the ability to light your katana on fire. The latter requires climbing a massive mountain, atop which supposedly sits a meteor with the ability to imbue blades with flames. While this would be dangerous in and of itself, a snowstorm threatens to freeze Jin before he makes it to the summit. The mission, then, revolves around navigating treacherous mountain paths while making sure to find sporadic campfires before Jin succumbs to the cold. The climbing mechanics are so barebones that they barely warrant a mention elsewhere, but in the swirling vortex of the blizzard, learning how to spot footholds and places to attach Jin’s grappling hook become vital. I won’t ruin what you find at the top, but the journey was enough to make the quest for a burning blade one of my favorite parts of <em>Tsushima</em>. I just wish the game offered more of these moments.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 kmfmg\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is pretty as heck—sporadic capturing left me with almost 50 GB worth of screenshots and short video clips to sift through—but at its core, it’s just another open-world game. I found myself audibly sighing every time I crested a hill towards a mystery objective only to find another fox to follow or another haiku to compose. These diversions, while unique at first glance, proved to just be busy work as time wore on. I was so strong by the end of the game—filling up every skill tree is easy if you ignore the main story and just explore for a bit—that I didn’t even bother using stealth tactics for the last third. I don’t think I even died after the first few hours. There’s so little to get excited about in <em>Tsushima</em> once the initial wonder of the wind physics and lush environments wears off that the only thing that kept me going was my own innate desire to fill out the entire map. And that can only hold someone’s interest for so long.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Ghost Of Tsushima: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/qaoejn0mhxyankd2kbvb.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-the-kotaku-review-1844368841', 'Ghost of Tsushima is a game of compulsion.

In the movies, Tony Stark’s advanced armor operates like VR, with a virtual screen projected inside his helmet. So when I put on my PSVR headset and started playing <em>Iron Man VR</em> I felt like that famous, armor-wearing superhero. Unfortunately, I didn’t have to just contend with super-villains. Technical problems ended up ruining much of my excitement and enjoyment. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Iron Man VR</em> is, as the name implies, a virtual reality game that is built for the PSVR headset and motion controllers. In it, you play as Tony Stark, the famous billionaire who once ran a weapons company, but became a crime-fighting superhero who wears a powerful mech suit. <em>Iron Man VR</em> isn’t set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but is heavily inspired by those films. Tony Stark in both the game and the MCU has a large ego, is quick to spit out a joke and seems to be hiding a lot of guilt over his weapon selling past. His home in the game has a near-identical layout to the MCU version of Stark’s Malibu mansion. Even his suit not only looks like the MCU Iron man suit, but has the same sound effects and abilities. This is good. It helped me get lost in the world more, as it is a world I’m very familiar with.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The setup for this Iron Man tale is the sudden appearance of the teleporting villain Ghost, who begins causing havoc in Tony’s life. So Stark reactivates The Gunsmith, a dangerous AI built before he was a superhero, to help him fight back. Gunsmith is a super-advanced weapon-building and combat-training AI that uses a Tony Stark hologram as its avatar. While Gunsmith is effective and helpful, his brash and dangerous plans often cause more headaches and problems for Tony and his more peaceful suit-based AI, Friday. The family dynamics among the three are the core of the story.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"hf4lmufhkwimav4wl9k0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hf4lmufhkwimav4wl9k0\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"hf4lmufhkwimav4wl9k0\" data-recommend-id=\"image://hf4lmufhkwimav4wl9k0\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Iron Man VR’</em>s world and characters are its strongest and most consistently good elements. The interactions between these various characters are my favorite moments. They joke around, they tease each other, they get on each other’s nerves and they bicker or fight. The writing is sharp and often genuinely funny or interesting. I cared about these characters and what was going to happen to them. Even the villains become sympathetic characters who get more fleshed out by the end of the game. There are still some dumb video game moments, like the boss fight at the very end and a few plot points that made me roll my eyes with how obvious and silly they were, but by and large, playing <em>Iron Man VR</em> felt like being part of an MCU film. A B-tier MCU film, like a <em>Thor </em>or an <em>Antman</em>, but still a solid and fun superhero adventure.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Great character dynamics and solid writing aren’t why folks are going to play <em>Iron Man VR</em>. People want to <em>be </em>Iron Man. They want to fly around, blow stuff up and fight supervillains. And this is where <em>Iron Man VR</em>, sadly, falls apart more often than not.<br></p>\n\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Iron Man VR\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"iron-man-vr\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Initially, I was impressed. It’s a bit gimmicky, but actually using the PS Motion controllers as Tony’s hand jets makes this feel unlike any other VR flying game I’ve played. To fly forward, you angle your hands behind your back. To stop, you can throw your hands in front of you, just like Iron Man does in the movies, and stop on a dime. It feels good. Turning is a bit less intuitive, as it is set to buttons on either controller, but I got used to it quickly and within a few minutes I was flying around like a pro. This is where I want to warn you that you need to have a strong VR stomach to play <em>Iron Man VR</em>. Whipping about at high speeds, while moving your head to look around— starting and stopping quickly—might cause some to feel motion sick. There are comfort settings you can turn on, like a setting that darkens the screen when you spin around fast, but this is still a fairly advanced VR game. I played with all of the comfort settings off and felt fine, but for less experienced or more sensitive VR players, be careful.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You don’t just fly in <em>Iron Man VR</em>, there’s also a bunch of combat. In theory, the combat controls seem smart. You hold your palms up to fire Iron Man’s famous laser blasts, and you point your wrist down to fire wrist-mounted auxiliary weapons, like grenades or missiles. You can also rocket punch enemies by holding a button and then punching. This may sound fine, but, in practice, it’s a bit of a mess.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"rt72iwagp7zwpfsg3a7y\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rt72iwagp7zwpfsg3a7y\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"rt72iwagp7zwpfsg3a7y\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rt72iwagp7zwpfsg3a7y\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are a few major issues. For starters, the PSVR tracking doesn’t feel precise enough to always detect some of the motions needed during combat. Often I would try to shoot people with my missiles, but end up shooting lasers instead, or vice versa. Another problem is that some of the motions needed for combat aren’t comfortable. For example, flipping your wrist down to fire a missile feels cool, but then you have to arch your arm and wrist back up slightly so the PS Move controller can actually aim at your target. It doesn’t work well and it quickly hurt my wrists. Punches don’t always register, and button presses sometimes felt delayed, adding to an overall sense of inconsistency and frustration during combat.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">However, I might have been able to ignore a lot of these problems if the game ran better during large combat sequences. Instead, the biggest problem <em>Iron Man VR</em> suffers from is poor performance. In a standard TV game, this isn’t always a deal-breaker. In a VR game, it is a huge problem. As I said before, I’m highly experienced with VR and have a strong stomach for all of the issues that can pop up, including huge FPS drops. And I’m thankful for that because I can easily see folks who aren’t as experienced getting headaches or becoming motion sick from the performance drops. I’m not talking about a few missed frames, but instead moments where the game almost becomes a slideshow. I played <em>Iron Man VR</em> on a PS4 Pro and still encountered these issues. It made the already finicky combat even more of a pain to deal with as I wasn’t just dealing with poor controls, but also annoying performance problems too.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And making all of this worse is just how much combat is in this game. You spend at least 75% of the game’s approximately eight hours of runtime fighting near-endless waves of drones and robots. The middle section <em>Iron Man VR</em> is a slog, filled with multiple levels where you fly into an area, get some story, and then fight a bunch of robots for 15 minutes. What’s frustrating is that the start and end of this game are so much stronger and more interesting than the slog of combat you deal with in the middle.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"eeftcwk7gpxc4ys9mnwh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://eeftcwk7gpxc4ys9mnwh\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"eeftcwk7gpxc4ys9mnwh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://eeftcwk7gpxc4ys9mnwh\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The beginning is filled with great character moments, a cool sequence with a plane (which is in the demo), and some simple, but cute “learning to fly” moments. The end section is also creative and different, forcing the player and Tony to figure out different ways to keep their suit powered up while trapped in a dark cave, being hunted the whole time. Instead of feeling all-powerful, you feel trapped in your suit as you desperately try to survive. These sections of the game make me wish I got something half as long, but with more of these types of sequences. Instead, <em>Iron Man VR </em>feels padded with endless combat and weapons in an attempt to make it feel more like a big, fully-featured video game.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Iron Man VR</em> would have been better off being smaller, focusing the game on telling a story and using the suit in interesting and fresh ways. Instead, it focuses on being a big combat simulator that’s too clumsy to enjoy. Strong voice acting and writing can’t overcome all of <em>Iron Man VR</em>’s technical problems, which are bad enough that I would warn most players who haven’t tried much VR to stay away. For those with strong VR stomachs and a love of the MCU, there’s enough here that you might have a good time. But you might be better off just downloading the demo instead. <br></p>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Iron Man VR: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/ffotskew3c9930qa2cm3.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/iron-man-vr-the-kotaku-review-1844238508', 'Iron Man feels like a perfect fit for virtual reality.

Every weapon reload, killing blow, and crafted item takes time and button presses. At times the game is painfully slow; even in the most action-packed sections you put in effort to move things forward. You’re paid for this work in a grim story and explicit violence. It can be exciting and beautiful, but mostly I just felt like shit.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong><em>This piece originally appeared 6/12/20. We’ve bumped it today for the game’s US release.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>The Last of Us 2</em>, out June 19 for PlayStation 4, is a sequel to Naughty Dog’s dark 2013 sort-of-zombie adventure <em>The Last of Us. </em>It’s a third-person game where your character is trying to exact revenge, but infected ex-humans and warring militias keep getting in the way. You can deal with these obstacles by sneaking past them, but more likely than not you’ll end up fighting them with limited ammo, improvised weapons like trip mines and pipe bombs, and a thrown brick or two. Its main setting of a post-apocalyptic Seattle is huge and challenging to navigate—when you aren’t fighting, you’re pushing debris out of the way, squeezing through gaps, and crawling under rubble. This gives the game a sense of effort and scale that make traversing a few city blocks feel like a huge adventure, but it’s also exhausting.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As suggested by interviews with its creators and its own marketing, <em>The Last of Us 2</em> is meant to feel very, very bad. Director Neil Druckmann has touted the game, as he <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRj3B3GY9KM&amp;list=PLol_ykYs3OQ56yDMhIlMYr3XS-QF8JbiX&amp;index=7\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRj3B3GY9KM&amp;list=PLol_ykYs3OQ56yDMhIlMYr3XS-QF8JbiX&amp;index=7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">described</a></span> in one video, as “a commentary about the cycle of violence” and a game that asks “philosophical questions” about revenge and consequences. Pre-release marketing made it clear the game would be a divisively violent, difficult experience. Going in, I wasn’t sure I <em>wanted</em> a game that asked me questions about the consequences of my actions, since I live in the world we all find ourselves in now, where I’m hyper-aware of the fact that a careless cough in the grocery store could kill someone I’ve never met. I knew it would be hard to play, especially now. I knew I probably wouldn’t enjoy it in any traditional sense.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">My playthrough of <em>The Last of Us 2</em> felt terrible to experience. Over the course of my 27 hours with the game, it grew to the point of feeling nearly unbearable. This wasn’t because it asked me hard questions about my own capacity for harm or revenge, or pulled some <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em>-style moralizing about video game violence. Despite Druckmann’s promised “philosophical questions,” I never felt like the game <em>asked</em> me anything. Instead, it told me “brutality,” repeatedly and louder, until by the end I couldn’t hear what it was trying to say at all. Characters make hideous, irredeemable choices, over and over. Everybody suffers, physically and emotionally, in graphic detail. This is all intended to prove a point, but the only point I got from the game was simply to be required to stare at violence, and play through violence, and then do that again, and more, and again, and more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"lfeckrigcfmwaizfhrum\" data-recommend-id=\"image://lfeckrigcfmwaizfhrum\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"lfeckrigcfmwaizfhrum\" data-recommend-id=\"image://lfeckrigcfmwaizfhrum\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A lot of this violence is just run-of-the-mill games violence, the kind I honestly don’t spend a lot of my time worrying about. The game’s world has been overtaken by a fungal infection that’s turned most of the population into zombies called Infected. They’re half-monster and half-plant, and they come in varieties that require different strategies. They’re terrifying and beautiful, and you respond to that beauty by knifing them in showers of blood and listening to them writhe and scream when you light them on fire with explosives. You also kill a lot of human enemies, whom the developers have given names and friends, and whose beliefs have led them to join one of two factions: the militant Washington Liberation Front or the religious Seraphites. Despite the factions’ ideological differences, they all die the same when you shotgun them in the face or nail them with an arrow. They cry in fear or call for the friends you’ve either killed or are about to. One faction has scent-tracking dogs—who you’ll also kill—who whine over their dead masters.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You’re supposed to feel bad about this—in his <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/three-hours-with-the-last-of-us-part-ii-1838458838\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/three-hours-with-the-last-of-us-part-ii-1838458838\">preview</a></span> of a section of the game, <em>Kotaku’</em>s reporter Nathan quoted narrative lead Halley Gross (known for her work on HBO’s <em>Westworld</em>) as saying of combat, “So much of what we’re trying to do is create empathy for the other. We make this enemy, and then how do we make you feel for them?” But the game’s story has so much more violence, so much more suffering that plays out over multi-stage quests and long cutscenes and effortful quicktime events, that I lost the ability to care about these everyday acts of carnage or whether I could have avoided them. There was only one combat moment in which I actually felt a moral qualm about killing enemies. I tried to avoid it, but as soon as my stealth attempt failed, I just shot my way through the survivors. This is perhaps a commentary—that it’s easier to inflict harm to get what you want than not—but by that point the game’s violence had worn me down so much that even these characters with names and friends and pets were just more virtual bodies on the pile.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’ve read this far into the review looking for more details about just what this game is about, there’s a catch. Even though many of the game’s plot details were unexpectedly leaked via a <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/hackers-are-likely-responsible-for-the-last-of-us-ii-le-1843230805\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/hackers-are-likely-responsible-for-the-last-of-us-ii-le-1843230805\">hack</a></span> in late April, a condition of us being able to review the game a week early with a Sony-provided copy is that we can’t spoil certain things. There’s plenty in the game I wouldn’t have spoiled anyway, since it’s full of events that are meant to surprise. And I can say that, having dug into those leaks, there was plenty in the game that surprised and shocked me. But key parts of the game’s story are off-limits here—not just how the game ends, for example, but also how it begins—as are large portions vital to explaining why I felt how I did about it. People who’ve seen the leaks may know some of this—though not all—but for the purposes of this review, there’s a whole lot to talk around.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The original <em>The Last of Us</em> told a story that felt small and human, whereas the second tells one of all-consuming vengeance. In that first game, a gruff middle-aged smuggler named Joel has to shepherd a 14-year-old girl named Ellie across the post-apocalyptic United States. Ellie is immune to the outbreak, and Joel is taking her to a medical base to see if her immunity can help create a vaccine. In the game’s astonishing ending—<strong>spoilers?</strong>—when Joel learns that making the vaccine will kill Ellie, he murders the doctor and takes her from the hospital. He lies to her about what happened, telling her a cure is impossible. The player is left wondering if Ellie believes him in the game’s last moments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>The Last of Us 2 </em>begins four years after that moment, 25 years into the outbreak. Joel and Ellie, now 19, live in a settlement in Wyoming. They’re estranged from each other, and their interactions are sorrowful and tense. Ellie’s life is grim, but it has safety and goodness too. When the game starts, she’s recently shared a kiss with a woman named Dina, an event Naughty Dog showed in the game’s E3 2018 <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A&amp;list=PLol_ykYs3OQ56yDMhIlMYr3XS-QF8JbiX&amp;index=16\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A&amp;list=PLol_ykYs3OQ56yDMhIlMYr3XS-QF8JbiX&amp;index=16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gameplay trailer</a></span>.<strong> </strong>In the early hours, players get a glimpse of Ellie and Dina’s lives. They go on patrol for Infected; they smoke a joint; they have sex; they start falling in love.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ich1wppfly6g3ycn9uq8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ich1wppfly6g3ycn9uq8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ich1wppfly6g3ycn9uq8\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ich1wppfly6g3ycn9uq8\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The characters are diverse, covering a range of genders, sexualities, and ethnicities. The game handles all of this well, neither downplaying it nor drawing undue attention to it. In a masterful scene, Ellie and Dina both share secrets; as a queer player, it felt wonderful to see queer characters confess things other than their sexuality. While I don’t consider representation alone an accomplishment, I appreciated the diverse cast. The game doesn’t make any big statements about it, which feels like the right choice—different kinds of people exist, and they face the game’s world, good and bad, like everyone else.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite the things in Ellie’s life that are going well, what happened at the hospital haunts her, and it strains her relationship with Joel. The lie eats at them both, whether they know it’s a lie or not. Joel struggles with the consequences of his choices; Ellie struggles to trust him while wrestling with her immunity to the outbreak and what good it could have done. There’s a way in which she’s untouched by the problem everyone else is having—she can’t get the disease that has taken so much from the world—but, as the player knows, any possibility that she could have done something about it is long dead.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I would have gladly played a version of <em>The Last of Us 2 </em>that explored these themes, that, like the first game, focused on the very human struggles of its characters set against a grim and brutal world. But that’s not the game we get. Inevitably, a violent tragedy ensues in Jackson. (That’s all I can tell you about it for now.) Ellie sets off on a revenge quest that consumes the rest of the game, which sends you to Seattle, puts you between two warring groups, and—those restrictions again!—escalates in gruesome ways.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game sends you on its revenge quest in a way that feels both narratively relentless and physically slow. In the early parts of the game, there are long stretches between combat and narrative in which you laboriously pick your way through the ruins of Seattle. By the middle of the game, I was fighting through consecutive tense areas that took time to navigate, and I’d long for a breather so my heart could stop pounding. Other times, something terrible would happen, only for me to be thrown back into combat without a moment to take it in. Tragic story events happened one after another. The game is divided into chapters, but events sometimes escalate without offering a natural stopping point, pushing me on even as I recoiled from what I’d witnessed.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"tcahy54ieww5lrdsirrh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://tcahy54ieww5lrdsirrh\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"tcahy54ieww5lrdsirrh\" data-recommend-id=\"image://tcahy54ieww5lrdsirrh\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Almost every moment in <em>The Last of Us 2</em> is hard. Much like in the first game, it takes forever to get anywhere, and so many objects in your way need to be lifted, pulled, and pried via button presses. Here, you can also crawl under things, squeeze through tight gaps, and throw and climb ropes, which you have to slowly gather one coil at a time. The obstacles in the first game created a pace that made sense—you were traveling across the country, after all—and here the new and old features combine evocatively with the size and wilderness of Seattle to make it feel treacherous. While <em>The Last of Us 2</em> never quite pulls off the beauty of the original’s <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfapMy-mIXo\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfapMy-mIXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">giraffe moment</a></span>, the nature that’s overtaken Seattle is gorgeous and awe-inspiring. Rapids crash through what used to be downtown streets, trees tower overhead, and the damp, lush greenery feel both prehistoric and so much like the Pacific Northwest. Nature also makes progress difficult; I often hit so many dead ends and overgrown areas in my journey toward a waypoint that I lost all sense of my initial destination until dialogue or a prompt reminded me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Combat seldom picks up the pace. It works fairly similarly to the first game: you’re neither a tank nor a ninja. You’re always outnumbered, and ammunition and crafting parts are in painfully short supply. You can improve your odds a bit via several skill trees, which are unlocked with findable manuals and upgradable with findable pills. There are skills that give you more health, make you move faster when prone, or let you craft more quickly. You can also upgrade your guns at workbenches using scavenged parts, reducing sway or increasing damage. All of this necessitates scavenging, which you’ll also need to do to find parts to craft pipe bombs, molotovs, and certain kinds of ammo. This search draws out combat moments: you’ll kill a few enemies, detour to rummage through drawers for supplies, hide somewhere to craft, and then head back to the fight. I enjoyed this pace, even when it made me ache for an encounter to be over.<br></p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"The Last Of Us Part 2\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"the-last-of-us-part-2\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Your best bet in combat is to sneak around picking off enemies one by one, aided by the “listening” ability that lets you see their outlines through walls. You can hide behind cover, or go prone in grass, but none of this is quite as sharp as it would be in a true stealth game. In most of my battles, something inevitably went wrong and multiple enemies would rush me. In these moments, I had better luck running frantically than standing my ground, where scarcity made head-on battles difficult and wasteful. Combat went the best for me when enemies would come to investigate a downed colleague and I could pick them off individually, or when they were far enough apart that I could take them down unseen. In these instances, I’d fall into a compelling rhythm of sneaking and grabbing. But then a particularly dangerous Infected would appear who’d require too much attention or ammo, or I’d run out of crafting materials necessary to keep fighting, or the door I’d finally made it to was locked and I knew it would be another real-world hour before I moved the story forward. None of this is bad—it’s a feel unique to <em>The Last of Us</em>, combining some of my favorite sensations of survival and stealth games—but it wore me out. As the game grew more difficult to stomach, the pace of the combat sometimes felt like punishment. I’d long to be done with what I was experiencing, only to have no choice but to trudge through it.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If <em>The Last of Us 2</em> was just a game where its story unfolded between characters while you played slow combat and explored nature, I would have found it fine. If it kept the emotional weight of the original, the relatable ways the characters’ relationships formed and dissolved, it would have resonated with me the way the first game did. I played that game for the first time with friends on release day; one of my friends, a comedian, did most of the playing as the weekend wore on. She made such great jokes while she did—the hilarious internal monologue she spun for Joel sticks in my memory seven years later—but as we played, the jokes faded out. We both sobbed at the end. It felt like we’d shared something incredibly special, an experience a game had never given us before. I’ve played the game on my own since, as well as the <em>Left Behind</em> DLC, but they’ve never affected me as much as seeing the original’s final moments for the first time.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"kwl2un5xurdohgk04agc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://kwl2un5xurdohgk04agc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"kwl2un5xurdohgk04agc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://kwl2un5xurdohgk04agc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">T<em>he Last of Us 2</em> didn’t give me any moments like that. In the above-quoted video, Druckmann says the core of the game is about “these really intimate, intense relationships.” I bring this up not to quote the game’s marketing, but to try to understand what the people who made it thought they were doing. The story I experienced was about relationships only insofar as characters did things to each other. I didn’t learn anything about what it means to be human, or what we’re capable of when we’re hurt, or what can happen when we want to hurt others. The way Joel hurt Ellie in <em>The Last of Us</em> felt relatable to me; even if the fate of humanity has never hung in the balance, I know how it feels to make a desperate, selfish choice to hang on to something you love. <em>The Last of Us 2</em>’s amount of cruelty and violence ultimately overwhelmed any chance of that relatability here. I didn’t find it prurient—the game doesn’t relish in its gory deaths or emotional suffering. It just takes every opportunity to show them, over and over, and decides that counts as saying something about them. It showed me so much ugliness, and in such detail, that I felt numb as terrible things befell more characters I cared about. Sometimes I did these terrible things myself, through gameplay. Sometimes I just watched things play out in front of me with no say in the matter, a lack of agency that was so skillfully used in the first game. Neither circumstance felt more affecting than the other; both just felt like <em>more</em>. The game’s diversity, which I appreciated at the beginning, just felt like an equal opportunity for different kinds of people to suffer as the game went on. Eventually, my numbness turned to an anger I’ve never felt about a video game. Late one night, I paused the game and asked myself aloud if the developers thought I was stupid, if they thought the existence of violence had just never occurred to me before.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s difficult to talk about all of this a week before most of you reading can play the game for yourself. In a recent fawning piece in British <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-part-ii-neil-druckmann-interview\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-part-ii-neil-druckmann-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>GQ</em></a></span>, Druckmann is quoted as saying, “There were people [at Naughty Dog]—a minority of them—that were just stuck on how violent it [the game] is and how dark and quite cynical it is about mankind.” That even the people who made the game are divided about it is a clear sign that players are going to have radically different experiences. The first game’s story was polarizing; this one’s will clearly be as well. So many people worked on this game for so long, and at <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962\">such cost</a></span>, that I want <em>The Last Of Us 2 </em>to be more than the experience I had. It’s a visually beautiful game that feels distinct to play, and the story it tells and how it tells it, at the most basic level, certainly pushes the edges of what games have done before. None of those accomplishments elevated or redeemed it for me. Like the nature consuming Seattle, or the outbreak consuming humanity, its ugliness overshadowed everything else. </p>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'The Last Of Us Part 2: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/xvvkwfpqbsj12rokxaqf.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-the-kotaku-review-1844006193', 'Everything in The Last of Us 2 takes work.

Your personal level of yearning to see Sega’s long-dormant rhythm game series make a comeback is likely to be proportional to the amount of fun you have with this week’s <em>Space Channel 5 VR Kinda Funky News Flash </em>for PlayStation VR. At its essence, it’s a simple, brief dance game, but the chance to step into its iconic universe is a fan’s dream.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">When Sega released <em>Space Channel 5</em> for the Dreamcast 20 years ago, the company was at the peak of its creativity. <em>Space Channel 5 </em>was a rhythm game following the broadcasts of a futuristic, vinyl-clad television news reporter whose on-camera appearances are invariably set to hot dance moves. It fit in perfectly with the console’s similarly stylish, offbeat ideas like <em>Jet Set Radio</em>, <em>Crazy Taxi</em>, and <em>Samba De Amigo</em>. The Dreamcast game’s development team, led by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, went on to make <em>Rez</em>, which has had a more robust post-Dreamcast life, including its own VR version. (Mizuguchi wasn’t involved in <em>Kinda Funky News Flash</em>, but other key members of the original team were.)</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Rather than remake the original game, the creators of <em>Kinda Funky News Flash</em> are telling a new story, although it once again pits heroine Ulala against a variety of aliens who want to get into deadly dance-offs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The major difference in this new version is that instead of pressing up, down, left, and right on a Dreamcast controller to do the moves, you’re moving a pair of PlayStation Move controllers, making <em>Space Channel 5 VR</em> more of a dance game than a strict beat-matching one.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Probably the smartest design decision here is that you are not playing as Ulala. You’re playing as a rookie reporter standing behind and to the right of Ulala. That means the iconic news anchor herself is there in the scene you’re seeing, part of the spectacle, instead of you being awkwardly Malkoviched into her head. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You also get the benefit of being able to watch Ulala do the exact dance moves you’re supposed to be doing, which I guess would be helpful if you don’t already get the call-and-response gameplay of the <em>Space Channel 5</em> series. First, the aliens dance a few steps, which is mostly just waving your arms in the four cardinal directions. Then you repeat what they did. Get it wrong four times in a row, and it’s game over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Besides the classic up, down, left, right, and “chu” (arms in front), you’ll also hear “pose” a lot. This is not a specific position—instead, you’ll have to watch your opponent and mimic their positioning. You’ll also occasionally have to dodge their attacks by moving your body to the left and right.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 rlnFM align--center js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ncla1mwctyhallktmfpw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ncla1mwctyhallktmfpw\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ncla1mwctyhallktmfpw\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ncla1mwctyhallktmfpw\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At first, I started out playing <em>Kinda Funky News Flash</em> as if it were, like its predecessors, a precision-timed beat-matching game. I’d snap my arms into the pose positions right on the beat. This actually worked well enough to get me through all four levels, but I’d often miss a lot of beats I thought I should have hit perfectly. As it turns out, I was pretty much doing it wrong. It seems like the game is just checking to make sure that the PlayStation Move controller’s glowy balls are in the right position at the right time in the song. So that means when they say “Chu, chu, chu!” and Ulala throws her hands in front of her three times in a row, you can just hold your hands in that position and register all three hits.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The tutorial doesn’t tell you this. Nor does it explain about the “secrets” you’re supposed to collect in each level. It turns out that they’re little circular patterns that appear at various times throughout the levels, and you’re supposed to reach out and hit them with your hand. I honestly thought they were weird loading icons or something, and my mind started to actually ignore them because I was so concentrated on the rest of the action. I only figured it out right as the game was ending.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That happened pretty shortly after it began. Much like the first <em>Space Channel 5</em>, which you can finish in well under an hour if you don’t fail a level, you can polish off <em>Kinda Funky News Flash </em>during a sufficiently long lunch break. The ending sequence is interactive and fun as well, so maybe we’ll call it four and a <em>half</em> levels. But it’s still pretty short.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Space Channel 5 VR: Kinda Funky News Flash!\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"space-channel-5-vr-kinda-funky-news-flash\">\n\n</section></aside>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">What’s there to do when you’re done? Not a whole lot. You can replay levels for 100 percent completion, but unlike the original game, <em>Kinda Funky</em> doesn’t add harder or more complex versions of those levels for your second playthrough. There’s a mode that lets you play 100 levels in a row with more and more dance moves, although that’s pretty much just hanging out in a single virtual area, and thus gets a little repetitive.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I don’t want to get too deep into what actually happens during the story, because that’s a great deal of the fun, and because as I’ve said, it’s such a brief ride that each little unexpected story beat is a precious moment. Although I suppose that if you have no intention of playing it, you can convert the final clause of this sentence out of ROT13 to find out that at one point Ulala ends up pehpvsvrq ba n tvnag svqtrg fcvaare. It was weird!</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The most important thing to say is that this is an authentic <em>Space Channel 5</em> experience. The wacky situations, the charming dialogue, the classy dance moves, the signature sounds of the classic 1966 jazz anthem “Mexican Flyer”—it’s all here, and it’s as timeless an aesthetic as it was 20 years ago. If that’s all you’ve wanted to hear, you’ll be as excited as I am for this interstellar dance adventure. Just know that it’ll be a short trip.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Space Channel 5 VR: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/bkbicm2jmzpu0cvebgqt.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/space-channel-5-vr-the-kotaku-review-1841910281', 'How badly do you want to play another Space Channel 5 game?

The game’s setting is lush and alive, its narrative heartwarming: A latchkey kid named Ash constantly revisits the ruins of Denska, the once-thriving port town he grew up in, to doodle. Denska has been abandoned and overtaken by Darkness, a mysterious force with the physical form of thorned purple vines, but Ash can’t stand to let the town go. He’s faced with the opportunity to take action, given a magical brush and a mission to restore the ghost town’s beauty. With a masterful sense of visual storytelling, the story is charming in its simplicity, full to bursting with warm, colorful memories and touching moments.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"j7vrga2q1l39yv6oyotm\" data-recommend-id=\"image://j7vrga2q1l39yv6oyotm\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"j7vrga2q1l39yv6oyotm\" data-recommend-id=\"image://j7vrga2q1l39yv6oyotm\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong><em>This piece was first published at midnight.</em></strong></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The gameplay never quite lives up to the loving design of the ramshackle town. After maybe 10 hours  scouring for secrets and messing around in free play mode, I wasn’t pulling my hair out. I just got a little bored with it. That did make it painful when I reached the short-lived final act, a total upturning of its mechanics, and realized that the gameplay was actually getting <em>good</em>.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"rlufouhmcpjvnmyzujxy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rlufouhmcpjvnmyzujxy\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"rlufouhmcpjvnmyzujxy\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rlufouhmcpjvnmyzujxy\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Ash progresses by moving through city streets and across rooftops with the aid of his Genies, creatures he’s drawn in his sketchbook. Each setting—a derelict lighthouse or a deserted hydroelectric plant, for example—features similar objectives. You must paint walls adorned by lightbulbs to illuminate them; find pages of your destroyed sketchbook, which can include new designs for the walls or the Genies themselves; and find spots to create new Genies. In the process, you can find newspaper clippings that provide extra context about the city of Denska, the environmental disaster that totaled it, and the tough-as-nails townsfolk who stuck it out for as long as they could before having to leave. Denska is still full of signs of life: leftover bottles and cars, neglected storefronts with stacks of CRT TVs, cheerful advertisements fading to a sullen gray. While finding one newspaper clipping, Ash remembers aloud the moment his family realized it was over: “when mom realized there was no place in town to buy milk.” It’s a simple story, expertly told.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"wkuzw8isxxhb9oulpd3b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wkuzw8isxxhb9oulpd3b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"wkuzw8isxxhb9oulpd3b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://wkuzw8isxxhb9oulpd3b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The problem is, playing through the game gets boring. After your first encounter with the Genies, you’re able to graffiti up most of Denska’s walls using either motion controls or the right stick. At certain locations, you can create new Genies with a similar interface, starting with the body and adding designs like horns, ears and tails. While there’s not an incredible amount of variety across the several bodies you get, the creatures are a clear nod to <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> and carry with them a real charm. The landscape options, anything from redwood trees and storm lilies to mushrooms and balloon plants, all look good, as do dynamic effects like the rain, which continues to fall whenever you pass by the wall. Butterflies and birds flutter outward from your brush, to your Genies’ great delight. But you get a total of 48 of these options to mess with, 12 each between four areas, and in a post-<em>Little Big Planet</em> world, it wasn’t enough to justify how much repetitive painting I had to do across wall after wall.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Concrete Genie\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"concrete-genie\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">At the end of each area, you’re invited to paint a “masterpiece,” a larger mural, where your Genies will have suggestions about what to put up. Despite the monotony, doing this is fun and sometimes happens in cool places, like a section where you climb high above the city and can see the entire town. Along the way, you can also find billboards to spruce up where you need the correct design. Completing puzzles like this unlocks rewards like concept art, which, unsurprisingly, is stunning.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ys2jhgefyuxpdqqek9rq\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ys2jhgefyuxpdqqek9rq\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2878\" data-height=\"1616\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ys2jhgefyuxpdqqek9rq\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ys2jhgefyuxpdqqek9rq\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2878\" data-height=\"1616\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Each of the three Genie types has its own powers, which can do things like set parts of the environment on fire for you to pass through. Puzzles largely consist of clearing Darkness so that your Genies can get through and magic away environmental obstacles. Sometimes, you have to paint a design the Genie requests in order to get them to help you, but that doesn’t add much and ultimately feels like a chore. Seeing some of the Genies’ interactions with your landscape paint is cute, but when the puzzles are already tedious, having to draw, I don’t know, some grass before your Genie will cooperate gets old.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"vwuqulrftdtswvlyo16b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://vwuqulrftdtswvlyo16b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"vwuqulrftdtswvlyo16b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://vwuqulrftdtswvlyo16b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Concrete Genie</em> rarely requires any real problem solving. This is one issue I can just barely excuse because it seems to have been made for a younger audience. Puzzles are straightforward, and the Genie you need to progress is always the next one you find, precluding any real puzzling beyond exploring and finding new areas. But undermining this is the fact that the gameplay often feels undercooked. Even as an adult, I found myself occasionally confused about how to progress. The game aggressively offers hints, which felt like a bandaid on moments of loose design. The puzzles generally featured only one way to progress, and the way forward, no matter whether that was using a water valve or flipping a switch, was generally to interact with the one interactive thing and then call your Genies. That was occasionally marred by the fact that it wasn’t always clear, for example, when a Genie would be blocked by Darkness given the nonlinear way they move through walls. Ultimately, it felt like there was this rich, beautiful world and too little to do in it.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"reankjukxaabs8watb20\" data-recommend-id=\"image://reankjukxaabs8watb20\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2644\" data-height=\"1486\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"reankjukxaabs8watb20\" data-recommend-id=\"image://reankjukxaabs8watb20\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2644\" data-height=\"1486\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You sometimes have to avoid bullies as you progress. Learning more about the kids who torment Ash with Senseless Kids’ Movie Thuggery is interesting, but the “stealth” really just requires you to jump on any nearby rooftop and you can’t be caught. Like the rest of the game, it works well narratively but fails to be fun.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"xeurym1alsygjkpsy5zm\" data-recommend-id=\"image://xeurym1alsygjkpsy5zm\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"xeurym1alsygjkpsy5zm\" data-recommend-id=\"image://xeurym1alsygjkpsy5zm\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I felt this frustration most when I got closer to the end, where the gameplay…actually got cool. After a certain point, the mechanics entirely switch and you’re in pursuit and combat situations, with abilities like “Paint Skating,” which allows you to glide around the town more quickly, and you get fireballs to shoot enemies with. Without giving too much away, you have to fight and then tame beasts using a number of offensive magical powers you get. You even get a <em>dodge roll</em> to use, which was far better than trudging around the streets of Denska like a regular, non-magical <em>pedestrian</em>. The  action section is far more fun than sneaking around Ash’s bullies and painting by number. The story continues to pick up here as well as Ash confronts his tormentors in a deeply affecting, earnest final act. Unfortunately, this part of the game is short-lived after the slog it takes to get there, but the decision to end on this note was a smart one. If only <em>Concrete Geni</em> had gotten there sooner or stayed there longer.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"l5ykldgoffjz92zr2qwj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://l5ykldgoffjz92zr2qwj\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"l5ykldgoffjz92zr2qwj\" data-recommend-id=\"image://l5ykldgoffjz92zr2qwj\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The story of <em>Concrete Genie</em> is well-told and relatable, a classic bullies-turned-friends story of empathy and growth with some real storytelling flair, including striking illustrations and a masterful, coherent use of a variety of art styles. The account of environmental disaster and a fishing town struggling to survive is rooted and told well from Ash’s young perspective. Pixelopus has a clear understanding of what makes a story work, even a story done as many times as this one: bullying, empathy, reconciliation. The fact that the game is gorgeous goes a long way, too. With the amount of love and care poured into the storytelling, I wanted more from the gameplay. If the first part of <em>Concrete Genie</em> were more tightly done, it could have easily been one of my favorite games of the year.  But like the fishing town of Denska itself, it faded before I could really appreciate it.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"pqy83rafavwsipunwcuc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://pqy83rafavwsipunwcuc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"pqy83rafavwsipunwcuc\" data-recommend-id=\"image://pqy83rafavwsipunwcuc\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Concrete Genie Takes Too Long To Get To The Fun Stuff', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/zfftdzl63nyzk6z7dwfu.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/concrete-genie-takes-too-long-to-get-to-the-fun-stuff-1838863633', 'When I started Concrete Genie, a new PlayStation 4 exclusive out now from Pixelo...', NULL);

You’re still given almost free reign over the fictional Tokyo distruct of Kamurocho, and you’re still running around getting into fistfights, buying energy drinks from convenience stores and getting caught up in a very elaborate tale about mobsters (try as they might, even with a name change, <!-- -->the studio just can’t stay <!-- -->away from the Yakuza).</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It is, at least, a new cast and a new story.

He ushers in a change of tone that permeates the entire game, for better and worse.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Better first!

Yagami’s tale may be pinned to a massive and often farcical conspiracy, but its beats and conclusion are really just a very personal and small-scale story about a man out for redemption. In doing so it also keeps the slapstick and bombastic set pieces to a minimum, a handful of literally explosive acts aside.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"rk14sewzwb0xnohfpyhr\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rk14sewzwb0xnohfpyhr\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"rk14sewzwb0xnohfpyhr\" data-recommend-id=\"image://rk14sewzwb0xnohfpyhr\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Notably for virtual tourists, for the first time since <em>Yakuza 2</em> we never leave the streets of Kanurocho during the course of the game, and the usual sprawling cast of gangsters has been replaced with a smaller, more manageable roster of friends and enemies that gives each far more space to grow, and for us to get to know them.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">All of which made <em>Judgment </em>a far more intimate experience than any of the recent <em>Yakuza </em>games, and I appreciated that immensely. The brevity even extends to the game’s overall design: this is a leaner, meaner affair, with most sidequests relegated to a jobs board in your office (so you don’t continually run into them on the streets) and a main story that can be wrapped up in around 20-25 hours. Even the series’ notoriously lengthy cutscenes have been trimmed, with few outside of the most pivotal moments clocking in at any longer than a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The downside to this tonal shift is that there’s now a strange gulf between the narrative that’s been crafted and the actual experience of playing. This is still very much a <em>Yakuza</em> game at heart, so you spend most of your time kicking bikes into dude’s faces, facing down hordes of street thugs with your bare hands and running around performing hilarious side-missions. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">That kind of stuff made sense when the characters you were playing as were as off-kilter as the action on screen, but here there’s a dissonance, where the feats you’re pulling off in combat are at odds with the more sombre and grounded action taking place in cutscenes. I mean, it’s explained very briefly that hey, your ex-lawyer detective guy also knows martial arts, but there’s a difference between “have done some karate” and “can beat the shit out of 12 cops without breaking a sweat”.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"jcpjexexti7y2khz1fvb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jcpjexexti7y2khz1fvb\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1841\" data-height=\"1029\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"jcpjexexti7y2khz1fvb\" data-recommend-id=\"image://jcpjexexti7y2khz1fvb\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"1841\" data-height=\"1029\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Not helping matters here is that in attempt to bridge that gulf, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have implemented some new systems into the game designed to play on its crime-solving, court case-winning vibe, which range from pixel hunts to <em>Phoenix Wright</em>-style accusations and presentations of evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Nearly all of them suck, and do little but place a handbrake on your adventures, as though they were simply implemented for the sake of it, to differentiate this slightly from the <em>Yakuza </em>games, rather than because they genuinely added something to the experience. The accusations are the most disappointing, since they can’t be failed and as such are of little consequence, but the <em>worst </em>are the seemingly endless tailing/stealth sections, which are broken, take forever and are generally a nightmare to endure.</p>\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Judgment\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"judgment\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s been suspected for a long time now, but free of <em>Yakuza’s</em> history <em>Judgment </em>finally gives us a chance to prove it: the real star of these games has never been their cast but their setting. Kamurocho is a video game wonder, whose consistency across games, despite its continual changes, makes it the PlayStation equivalent of a comfortable pair of slippers. And in <em>Judgment</em>, it’s never looked better.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Setting the entire game here, without the customary vacations to places like Osaka or Okinawa that we’ve gotten used to lately could have felt cramped, but the distance <em>Judgment </em>puts between itself and its <em>Yakuza </em>past lets us see the city in a new light. It’s a strangely comforting—and novel in an industry that’s always desperate to take you to new places—experience to be able to revisit some of the key locations of a series that’s over 15 years old, and what in a <em>Yakuza </em>game was a key location is in <em>Judgment </em>just some bar you can buy a beer in.

I really enjoyed my time with <em>Judgment</em>, partly because I took a shine to the new, more human cast, but mostly because the basic <em>Yakuza </em>building blocks of “smashing traffic cones into ribs” married with “a soap opera about angry dudes” is still loads of fun.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It would have been nice if those two things could have been stitched together a little more neatly, but then subtlety has never been a <em>Yakuza </em>strongpoint.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"beruxkabzu8vzsrmk95c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://beruxkabzu8vzsrmk95c\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"460\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"beruxkabzu8vzsrmk95c\" data-recommend-id=\"image://beruxkabzu8vzsrmk95c\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"460\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Judgment: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/g8wppifo2ah186lsgtrk.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/judgment-the-kotaku-review-1835790070', 'Yakuza 6 closed the book on the story of fabled gangster Kazuma Kiryu, but Ryu G...', NULL);

There are people who must do it for a living: government employees who specialize in disaster relief and crisis response, civil engineers, military personnel—people who must imagine the end to make sure it never comes. But there are others: Fundamentalist evangelicals waiting for a rapture. Libertarian preppers who shun government and pride themselves on self-sufficiency. Conspiracy theorists and internet nihilists. Anyone remotely concerned with the future of the planet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">For most people, this is optional. You choose to be someone who thinks about the end, and that choice colors your attitude in the present, for good or ill. In video games, however, the doom of civilization is old hat. It’s so familiar that we’ve moved past it, affixing a genre name to what comes after: The post-apocalypse, where we find games like the new single player PlayStation 4 exclusive <em>Days Gone.</em></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Post-apocalyptic stories are an easy mark for video games to hit, precisely because they justify all sorts of behavior that’s hard to deal with in any other setting. For developers interested in rooting video games in believable narratives, they’re liberating. They provide a context in which violent people with sticky fingers seem pretty reasonable. The trouble, then, comes when a game tells a story within this familiar context, and ultimately finds itself trapped by its tropes. <em>Days Gone</em> displays little that reaches beyond its many influences and contemporaries, instead settling for being a hollow simulacrum of them all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">***</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In <em>Days Gone</em> you play as a man named Deacon St. John. He survives in the forests of rural Oregon after the end of the world, when hordes of rabid, zombie-like monsters called Freakers overran everything, bringing about society’s collapse. Deacon’s past life as a member of the Mongrels MC biker gang makes him ideally suited to life in The Shit, as they call it, and also ideally suited to being a video game protagonist. He has a motorcycle he rides, cares for, and improves. He’s proficient with firearms, and has zero qualms about using them. He has a sympathetic past, where he is separated from his wife at the end of everything, and presumes her dead. And he has a code, one that mostly just involves rage at anyone who dares point a gun at an unarmed woman.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There isn’t much to Deacon that doesn’t seem like it’s there for the purpose of making a video game, and a very specific kind of video game at that. You know what kind of game, because you’ve likely played it more than once: A third-person action game with guns for shooting and cudgels for swinging and recipes for crafting weapons. A game where you scrounge for vague resources like “scrap” and “rags,” encounter different factions of humans that want you dead, and various phenotypes of Freaker to be wary of, and between all of them, endless corpses to loot. And, of course, there are experience points and skill trees with abilities to unlock.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">These systems are all standard-issue, part of the industrial hum of big-budget video games. They’re like a laugh track in a sitcom—standard operating procedure for a work of mass appeal, even if it signals creative complacency. Including them is fine, but it puts more pressure on the other aspects of a game to elevate the whole. </p>\n\n<aside contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"sc-cqxoak-0 fmgNoB align--fullbleed js_lazy-image\"><section title=\"Days Gone\" class=\"sc-blwhls-12 dYAIfx reviewbox-inset\" id=\"days-gone\">\n\n</section></aside><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There’s not much you can point to in <em>Days Gone</em> if you were looking for a calling card, a signature feature that makes it distinctive. The easiest place to look for this is in the motorcycle that you, as Deacon, spend the game using. It can be upgraded, though there are only about a handful of upgrades for every major part, improving things such as speed, traction, damage resistance, and fuel tank size. The cosmetic improvements are more plentiful, but also limited—you can only paint so much of the bike’s frame, or apply a unique skin wholesale. You don’t spec the bike out to handle different situations. It is improved as a matter of course, when the game makes new parts available to you and a faster, hardier bike would come in handy.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Since <em>Days Gone</em> requires you to be near your bike to save or fast travel, and because you need enough gas in the tank in order to make the trip, you must be responsible with fuel management. You also should stop and make repairs whenever your bike takes too much damage. There’s the implication that your potential interactions with your motorcycle might make for something meaningful and distinct, a bike that’s yours in a way that extends beyond a paint job and a cool headlamp. Instead, the game treats the motorcycle the way other games treat horses. It’s your ride. It gets the job done in such a strictly efficient way you might altogether forget that motorcycles are, in fact, awesome.  </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">***</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The glut of post-apocalyptic fiction in pop culture at large and video games in particular has led to a set of beliefs and tropes that have settled into the bones of these stories: A moral nihilism that posits compassion as weakness, that the ends justify the means, that there is a thin line protecting us from them and it extends directly from the barrel of a gun. In the post-apocalypse, we hold these truths to be self-evident, to challenge them is to rail against gravity.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"oyg6ean2uh4v6za44epv\" data-recommend-id=\"image://oyg6ean2uh4v6za44epv\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"oyg6ean2uh4v6za44epv\" data-recommend-id=\"image://oyg6ean2uh4v6za44epv\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Days Gone</em> almost dares to grapple with this, to argue that maybe there’s virtue in pushing against the mean math of survival that we’ve come to accept as necessary and obvious, something more to the preservation of society than guns in the hands of people who believe in order and rule of law. It puts these notions in the mouths of characters who argue with Deacon, a drifter for whom getting by is the only thing that matters.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Toward the end of the game’s first act, you meet the most prominent voice that pushes against Deacon’s drifter philosophy: Iron Mike, a man who’s forged a treaty with the most hostile human enemies in the game and believes in the sanctity of life for all, even the monstrous. “Caring will get you killed,” Deacon tells him, believing Iron Mike to be a fool. “Not caring will get you killed just as easy,” he replies.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Instead of having Deacon wrestle with these ideas and giving players meaningful ways of engaging with them, the game instead introduces a series of antagonists unquestionably worse than the existential threat of the Freaker hordes and Deacon’s ambiguous morality, villains who force everyone to put these debates aside, or even yield to survival tropes and their tired absolutes. It sidelines any sense of self-examination its narrative might lead to, and buries it further by wrapping it all up in a story of love, brotherhood, and a drifter learning to call a place home again. It’s a saccharine frame that attempts to paper over messy, incoherent themes with sentiment, only to draw more attention to them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">***</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Playing <em>Days Gone</em> is a lot like playing most other games of its stature. You will visit camps populated by merchants to buy gear from and characters to talk to. Those characters will send you out on jobs, usually involving finding something or someone or killing something or someone. They’re all solid, with the exception of frequent, bafflingly bad stealth missions where you must spy on government researchers, staying close enough to eavesdrop while avoiding their armed escorts. Stealth in <em>Days Gone</em> is basic to the point of hilarity—crouch in a bush up to Deacon’s neck and every character will treat you as invisible—but these missions frustrate by making guards invincible, and by arbitrarily restricting you from using rocks to distract them. Get spotted once, and you have to restart them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Barring that low, most of the game’s main and side missions hold steady. The best missions are the mostly optional freaker hordes. Hordes are the most technically impressive thing in <em>Days Gone</em>, massive, frightening swarms of freakers that seem to number in the hundreds. (It’s impossible to count them but you can guess by the number of bounties they leave behind for you to collect—one horde left me with over 200.) Freaker hordes require planning to take out, and will overrun you if all you do is square up with a really big gun. They also have a way of wandering into places you need to be for other missions, and have the nice effect of being the one genuinely chilling, panic-inducing thing in a game that’s about a zombie apocalypse. Taking on a horde is thrilling and fun in a way that makes everything else feel mundane.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"omgbvuozr1unxighuqua\" data-recommend-id=\"image://omgbvuozr1unxighuqua\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1440\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"omgbvuozr1unxighuqua\" data-recommend-id=\"image://omgbvuozr1unxighuqua\" data-format=\"png\" data-width=\"2560\" data-height=\"1440\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are a few thoughtful touches in its design that suggest <em>Days Gone</em>’s developers have sympathy for the player of large big-budget games. Instead of a standard quest log, <em>Days Gone</em> tracks your progress through various “storylines.” A few, like the storyline that tasks you with the optional task of clearing out Freaker nests you find in the world, are glorified to-do lists. Most, however, are a genuine attempt to keep track of how every mission advances each subplot and character arc, doubling as a good way to remind yourself of story beats after time away. All of them clearly denote your rewards for completing each mission and do a lot to help you prioritize what’s worthwhile in a given session and what’s best saved for later, or skipped entirely.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">On the other hand, there are times where <em>Days Gone</em> seems to be barely holding it together, with frequent bugs that run the gamut from amusing to frustrating. A puddle on a bridge somehow became an ocean, swallowing me and drowning me in the river beneath. The frame rate stuttered and occasionally froze outright for a few seconds. And the audio was generally a mess, with gunfire occasionally going silent, my motorcycle engine revving while idle, and dialogue coming in at volumes that make it hard to determine who is talking: too low for parts of long motorcycle rides, or too loud in comparison to the sound of the engine that suddenly dipped for no reason.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Through it all, the game remained playable and only crashed once on my Playstation 4 Pro, late in my 30-hour playthrough, corrupting a save file I had created just before things went haywire. Fortunately, <em>Days Gone</em> is generous with autosaves, and I never felt in danger of losing a lot of progress. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Despite its substantial bugginess, there’s an efficiency to the design of <em>Days Gone</em>. It’s very easy to keep playing, unoriginal as much of it is.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">***<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"ldgshgjlfha1fbcdsp07\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ldgshgjlfha1fbcdsp07\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"ldgshgjlfha1fbcdsp07\" data-recommend-id=\"image://ldgshgjlfha1fbcdsp07\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But we were talking about the end of the world.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">A possible explanation for video games’ love affair with the oxymoron of the post-apocalypse is that it is reductive: Doomsday means the end of most everything, and that means we can wipe away all the complicated and contradictory and messy rules and feelings that come with humanity and in their stead, replace them with something more primal. Have you survived or not? It’s a simple binary, and as elaborate systems run by computers, video games are very good at handling binaries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The problem comes when video games rig the score. <em>Days Gone</em> is a third-person action game with a layer of survival baked in. It’s about shooting things and foraging for useful equipment to better your chances at staying alive in an increasingly hostile environment. Those are expressed through play, and even when said play is derivative as <em>Days Gone</em> is, it can still be compelling.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Deciding what that <em>means</em> through narrative is something else altogether, and where the tropes of the post-apocalypse become most grating. In <em>Days Gone</em>, Deacon St. John has done horrible things, and so has everyone else. Deacon and his cohorts would like things to not be this way, but they are, and them’s the breaks. And it is tiresome<em>. </em>It is exhausting to watch another gruff white dude experience the extremes of humanity brought about by disaster, to be torn between pure, reliable self-interest and the fragile strength of community, as if those are the only two ways to be. It’s dumping water into the ocean, failing to offer anything new in favor of blending formlessly into arguments made by 10 years of <em>The Walking Dead</em> and countless post-apocalyptic games of its ilk. Look no further than the game developers calling the zombies “freakers,” and expecting us to take that as something new.</p>', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', '2024-01-10 17:12:01', 'Days Gone: The Kotaku Review', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/zidwsvlelpazppjfhzax.jpg', 'ps4', 'https://kotaku.com/days-gone-the-kotaku-review-1834287975', 'It’s worthwhile to think about the number of people around you who are waiting f...', NULL);

They’re bipedal, they wear clothes, you put some make-up on, get a weapon, boom, you’re cosplaying as a Nintendo character. But what about <em>Breath of the Wild’s</em> Guardians, those giant stone warriors that shoot lasers out of their face, surely a human being couldn’t realistically cosplay as one of those?<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Of course they can.

Nearly the entire unit is made of pieces of foam that have been individually wrapped in coloured, synthetic leather, which unlike painted pieces can look a lot smoother and metallic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s a technique that allows for a suit that both looks and moves well, and is the way shows like <em>Power Rangers </em>(and countless other tokusatsu series) have been made for decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I’ve mentioned a few times now how the suit moves without actually showing it, so here’s a short video Maolo made that highlights how the suit allows for a surprisingly quick and natural range of movement for something that’s so angular and has so many pieces.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can see more of Maolo’s amazing cosplay work <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://twitter.com/SunnyMaolo\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://twitter.com/SunnyMaolo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">at their Twitter page</a></span>, including shots of one of their other Evangelion suits, like the one below.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"94d9c6140f5146cea8f0901aa06fdff9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://94d9c6140f5146cea8f0901aa06fdff9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1536\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"94d9c6140f5146cea8f0901aa06fdff9\" data-recommend-id=\"image://94d9c6140f5146cea8f0901aa06fdff9\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1536\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>', '2024-01-10 17:47:01', '2024-01-10 17:47:01', 'Neon Genesis Evangelion Cosplay Gets In The F**king Robot', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/a367ce659c2c5ccc6d83721227bfad0f.jpg', 'cosplay', 'https://kotaku.com/neon-genesis-evangelion-cosplay-gets-in-the-fucking-rob-1848134616', 'I’ve lost count of the amount of Neon Genesis Evangelion cosplay I’ve posted on ...', NULL);

This decision was reached after every possible scenario to hold our event safely was considered. We have been working for several months on structural changes to the convention layout and operation in order to make a safe Katsucon 2021 possible. While we had every intention of moving forward with the safest possible convention under these structural changes, in the end, we and the Gaylord National Convention Center have come to the conclusion that we are unable to hold our event up to our standards per current county and state COVID regulations, making it impossible to have Katsucon in February 2021. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While our goal is to put on the best convention possible, ultimately it is the health &amp; safety of our staff, guests, and attendees that is of the utmost concern. We know that this decision may have seemed inevitable in the face of this global pandemic, but that makes this no less heartbreaking to see a Katsucon missed for the first time in 27 years.

This is during the height of the Empire’s reign, and that’s why Kay is constantly on the run.

According to Narrative Director Navid Khavari, the team wanted<em> </em>to explore the ground-level impact of <em>Star Wars</em>’ intergalactic conflicts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">“We always knew we wanted to create an original scoundrel story,” Khavari <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-interview-ubisoft-1313-ragtag-1851118340\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-interview-ubisoft-1313-ragtag-1851118340\">told <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>. “There was something exciting about looking at [this universe] from the perspective of a scoundrel like Kay, who has no experience with the Empire, Jedi, Rebellion or the Sith.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h95370\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>How does it play?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Star Wars: Outlaws </em>looks like a Ubisoft game in more ways than one. Yes, it has the open-world structure that’s become synonymous with the company, but it also has stealth action elements like sneaking, parkour, and stealth attacks reminiscent of the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813/slides/4\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813/slides/4\"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em></a></span><em> </em>series. There’s also some cover shooter elements, and hand-to-hand combat, and you can manipulate the environment by sending Nix to hit switches and pick up items across the battlefield.<br></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In addition to on-foot combat, <em>Outlaws </em>has vehicle combat, too, withlast year’s Ubisoft Forward showing Kay firing her blaster while on a speeder bike, slowing down time to line up her shots.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f3a56602c98792916b0bbb890e1cf5f3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f3a56602c98792916b0bbb890e1cf5f3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kay sneaks behind containers to avoid Empire forces.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f3a56602c98792916b0bbb890e1cf5f3\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f3a56602c98792916b0bbb890e1cf5f3\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Kay sneaks behind containers to avoid Empire forces.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Kay’s blaster seems to have different settings and modifications that change its function. The ones seen in the demonstration included a stun mode and a “focused” mode, which appear to work better on certain enemies or obstacles. The focused setting helps apply pressure on shielded enemies, allowing Kay to get in close for a melee finisher.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h95371\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Wanted system</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Part of being a wanted criminal is being on the run. <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>has a reputation and wanted system similar to that in <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-rumor-leak-release-date-rockstar-1850718620\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-rumor-leak-release-date-rockstar-1850718620\"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a></span>, which means if you’re caught doing crimes, you might find yourself on the wrong side of an imperial blaster. Your reputation with different factions will affect how easily you can access certain areas, so while you’re bound to make some enemies on your way through space, it will be important to keep in mind who hates you the least while traveling.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h95372\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>That’s cool and all, but what about space travel?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Kay’s adventure spans the galaxy, and she can fly around it in her Trailblazer starship. From space, she can fly to different destinations and take part in some space combat against the Empire’s forces. You can also jump to lightspeed while in space to escape Imperial forces and cool down your wanted meter.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h95373\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Dialogue choices, but not branching threads</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As seen in the demonstration video, <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>features dialogue choices that let you color in the lines of who Kay is.

And that’s fine. But after about 20 minutes, I struggled to hear what people were saying. Looking at the default settings, voice volume isn’t as high as it probably should be, so knock that up a bit and turn music down a little, too. Trust me, you’ll still be able to hear it fine.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94575\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Loot the pirates after the first fight for an assault rifle</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The first big fight in <em>Starfield</em> isn’t very hard and the game quickly pushes you to leave. But first, go grab at least one assault rifle (and some other goodies) off those pirates you just wasted.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94576\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Loot everything and give it to Vasco</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Speaking of looting stuff, feel free to grab everything and just dump it on the robot who partners up with you in the early hours of <em>Starfield</em>. Like in previous Bethesda games, your companions are pack mules with dialogue trees. Use ‘em! To do so, just chat with the bot (or other companions) and ask to trade items.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94577\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use cover like a modern shooter</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Aiming near cover will have you pop out in a way that feels unlike any previous Bethesda RPG. Sure, dynamic cover like this has been around since 2012-ish, but hey, I’m not going to complain about <em>Starfield</em> having good combat compared to <em>Fallout 4</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94578\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use the laser mining tool for killing</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Cutter you get at the very beginning is deceptively great in battle. It works on a cooldown with unlimited ammo, and can stun-lock enemies at close range.

You might be mistaken and think you have to do that every time you want to take it off or put it on. (And you need it out in space to live.) But nope! Just leave it and your suit on, then go into the inventory section for each. You’ll find an option at the bottom of the screen letting them disappear automatically when not needed, like in towns or stations. No more running around cities looking like a giant dork!</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94580\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Pump up your persuasion trait ASAP!</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you don’t want to waste all your resources fighting through every encounter, make sure to put some points into persuasion. It will increase the odds that you can talk people down from fights and generally make it much easier to manipulate people, which is why you’re playing this game, right?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94581\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Careful you don’t sell your equipped gear</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game won’t check you while you’re pawning off all your loot so spam that sell button with caution.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94582\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Save time by fast-traveling directly through the quest menu</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You don’t always have to navigate through your cumbersome star chart to get to a new planet. If you want to go to the next location for a mission and you’ve already been there before, simply use the “select course” option from the pause menu to automatically head to the destination.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"c0738ff6a2adaddb9b8de30dc3730aa5\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c0738ff6a2adaddb9b8de30dc3730aa5\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An image shows an astronaut exploring an alien world. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"c0738ff6a2adaddb9b8de30dc3730aa5\" data-recommend-id=\"image://c0738ff6a2adaddb9b8de30dc3730aa5\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"An image shows an astronaut exploring an alien world. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94583\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Scan everything all the time</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Starfield</em> basically gives you detective vision. In addition to scanning planets, your helmet sensor will also scan everything right in front of you, highlighting nearby enemies and valuable loot. This is also how you survey fauna for extra XP. Plus, you can use it to find your ship’s location on the horizon and instantly fast travel to it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94584\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Don’t forget to take a nap</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sleeping will fully heal you and also give you a “well-rested” bonus that increases the rate at which you earn XP.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94585\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use the research station on your ship to get access to more craftable stuff</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can upgrade guns, suits, and helmets as well as cook food in this game. But you’ll need to do some research first. You’ll need some materials, like iron and fiber, but once you have some you can unlock new mods and things to craft, letting you improve guns and make good suits even better.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94586\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Hitting undo while lockpicking still spends a digipick</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So be careful, they’re hard to come by!</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94587\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use your ship inventory</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You don’t just have to give all of your extra items to companions or throw them on the floor, you can also store them in the ship’s cargo hold by selecting it from the ship part of the menu (bottom left). It’s not unlimited but it has more than enough room in the beginning. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94588\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Designate weapons and healing items as favorites to save time</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">As far as I can tell, in the first few hours of the game at least, <em>Starfield </em>doesn’t say anything about favoriting weapons. But you should totally do that! Like in past Bethesda games, you can map guns, medkits, knives, and more to your d-pad and then quickly switch weapons during combat without needing to open the game’s (not great) menus. Simply replace an item with something else to change up your favorites.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94589\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Look for beds when clearing out space dungeons</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Battles in <em>Starfield </em>can be tough, especially early on. And if you don’t have many medpacks to heal your wounds, you might end up in a bad situation. However, many outposts and enemy camps contain beds that you can sleep in to heal back up to full HP. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can’t sleep in active combat so you’ll need to hide from the AI a bit if enemies are around, but that’s usually pretty easy. You can also sleep after big fights, before moving deeper into the location, so as not to waste medpacks.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94590\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Be careful with contraband</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">In <em>Starfield</em> contraband items—marked with a yellow icon—are very valuable but also tricky to sell, as any time you warp into <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/starfield-faction-best-quests-crimson-fleet-reward-join-1850805835\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/starfield-faction-best-quests-crimson-fleet-reward-join-1850805835\">UC or Freestar space</a></span> you’ll be scanned for these items. And if you have some on your ship, you’ll be in a lot of trouble. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">However, you can install (or find a ship that includes) a shielded cargo hold that will let you smuggle these items around with less threat of being caught and sent to space jail.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94591\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Get drunk (or take certain chems) before trying to persuade</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">There are moments in <em>Starfield </em>where you’ll need to persuade an NPC, perhaps to get what you want or to make them change their mind. While I recommend leveling up your Persuasion skill, you can also make these moments easier by consuming chems or booze that boost your Persuasion ability for a short time.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94592\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Also, always carry some Amp on you</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Speaking of chems, always carry some Amp on you.

And it can happen easily in the early hours of the game. To avoid this, make sure you check your entire inventory for heavy items. You can do this by selecting all items in your inventory screen and then sorting everything by weight. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Keep an eye out for ship parts, which are useful on your ship, but worthless and very heavy paperweights in your character’s inventory.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94595\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Don’t ignore the main quest (seriously)</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">No story spoilers here, but trust us: Play the main questline. You don’t necessarily need to finish it right away—even if there is some cool stuff waiting for you in new game+—but definitely make progress in it. Not only are the story quests pretty good all around, but you’ll unlock some…extra things worth having. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94596\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use your jetpack on low-grav planets to move quickly</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Once you unlock the jetpack (or the boostpack as it’s called in-game) use it! This can help speed up traversal on planets with low gravity as you can fly long distances by timing your jets properly, letting your stamina recharge in the process. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94597\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Level up lockpicking early</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’ve played a lot of Bethesda games, you know that being able to lockpick and hack anything can be extremely useful.

Even better, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/starfield-lockpicking-digipicks-minigame-help-fun-xbox-1850797165\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/starfield-lockpicking-digipicks-minigame-help-fun-xbox-1850797165\">the digital lockpicking skill</a></span> covers <em>both </em>doors and computers. Level it up ASAP so you can unlock better loot and find easier routes during some quests. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94598\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Also, always buy lockpicks and medpacks at stores</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Another tip I’ve picked up from past Bethesda games: Always be buying lockpicks and health kits. Seriously, make it a habit to check for these items every time you arrive at a shop or meet up with a merchant.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h94599\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Slap some extra cargo on your spaceship</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Being able to drop off all your resources and heavy, valuable loot at your ship is handy! However, you’ll quickly run out of room in your cargo hold if you don’t upgrade it. While there is a perk you can upgrade to improve your ship’s cargo capacity, I recommend installing more storage units on your ship. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can do this at any port with a ship tech NPC, and it’s not very expensive. Just open up the ship builder, grab some cargo storage containers, and attach them to your starship. Now you can carry even more random junk you find during your galactic adventures.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">  <strong>Update 9/7/2023 4:05 p.m. ET: </strong>After playing more <em>Starfield, </em>we’ve added 11 more tips to this list!</p>', '2024-01-10 18:27:01', '2024-01-10 18:27:01', '28 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Started Playing Starfield', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/17abb90c9698bb10802c31de9a363c50.jpg', 'game-tips', 'https://kotaku.com/starfield-tips-guide-xbox-money-fast-travel-map-traits-1850798018', 'Starfield is finally here and it is big, complex, and often overwhelming.

You’re not playing a game with a like-minded adult who shares your sense of purpose or your temperament. One minute you’re co-opping with a volatile, rage-quitting narcissist then a condescending, proficient genius the next. Whether this is your first time playing <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/tag/mario\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/tag/mario\">Mario</a></span> in decades or you’re a lifelong devotee, these tips are designed to help you facilitate a fun session for everyone. And for parents of little ones, we’ve got some extra tips for you, too.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103223\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Mario Wonder</em> Tips for Kids of All Ages</h2>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103224\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Don’t Be Too Goal Oriented</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">You can’t help being an adult. It’s hard work, and conditions you to approach life a certain way. No judgment: Being a productive, task-oriented person is what our entire education system is based on. Once you’ve gone through school and spent a few years working you have a compulsion to get shit done the right way. Kids are different.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’re playing alongside them and find yourself saying you’re “supposed” to do something—i.e. “you’re supposed to get those big purple coins!”—switch gears. <em>SMBW</em> is a great playground, so slow down and have fun. Seeing the game through a child’s eyes will give you a new appreciation for its incredible level design.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103225\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Replay Fun Courses</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Sometimes a level is just a lot of fun and you can’t wait to do it again. So don’t! If your kid thinks the Hoppos are hysterical, then play the Hoppo level as long as they want. If they’re really good at the Parachute Hat Badge Challenge, let them do it again and again. The difficulty curve in <em>SMBW</em> will sneak up on you and can hit kids pretty hard. Nothing takes the fun out of a night of gaming faster than running into a level no one can beat. So avoid frustration at all costs. You can always come back and play more once the kids go to bed. There’s multiple save files for a reason.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103226\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Pro Controllers Are a Wise Investment</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While it’s admirable that the Switch comes with two built-in controllers, using a single Joy-Con to play games for any substantial length of time isn’t ideal. This is especially true for parents who aren’t gaming much, or those more accustomed adult-sized controllers. If this sounds like you, then consider investing in a Switch Pro Controller (<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-parents-guide-tips-kids-1850989760&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B01NAWKYZ0\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">like this one</a></span>) to make life easier. Odds are you’ll like it so much, you’ll end up getting more than one. There are also plenty of less expensive third-party alternatives, whether you prefer corded or wireless controllers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"69ed3eaffd5dc7a4234590060fac4275\" data-recommend-id=\"image://69ed3eaffd5dc7a4234590060fac4275\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Yellow Toad fly toward the flagpole at the end of a level. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"69ed3eaffd5dc7a4234590060fac4275\" data-recommend-id=\"image://69ed3eaffd5dc7a4234590060fac4275\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Yellow Toad fly toward the flagpole at the end of a level. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103227\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><em>Mario Wonder </em>Tips for Younger Kids<br>\n</h2>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103228\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Let Them Have The Crown</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">On paper, the mechanic of having the player who gets the best score earn a little crown to wear seems cute and harmless. A silly little thing that has no bearing on the game and is essentially meaningless. Unless you are a small child. Then, suddenly and without warning, the crown will become the most important thing in your life. You will wail and despair if someone else has the crown, even if they get it by accident. So, parents, a word of warning. Let your kid get the crown. If you’re navigating siblings you may need to institute some hard rules on sharing, or wear the crown yourself in a “if you can’t play nicely you can’t play at all” situation. In the meantime let’s pray Nintendo lets us disable this feature in a future update.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103229\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>No-Damage Characters Have a Catch</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">One of the things that sets Nintendo apart from Sony and Microsoft is their dedication to family-friendly gaming. This comes through in a lot of places in <em>SMBW</em>, but the addition of the Yoshis and Nabbit is probably the biggest accommodation they’ve made in franchise history. These characters can’t take damage, so young players (or adults) can still go through levels without getting too frustrated by the challenge.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The caveat is that these characters can’t use power-ups. This could be very upsetting for young players (or adults) who wanted to see Elephant Yoshi. This may not be a dealbreaker but probably something you want to mention before starting a level together.</p>\n<h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h103230\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Mario Teaches Reading</h3>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Who says games aren’t educational? Sure, Mario may be miles away from Ms. Rachel, but don’t fool yourself into thinking <em>SMBW</em> is pure brain candy. There’s plenty of dialogue and text to read, full of the common sight words kids are learning in elementary school. You can also apply the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/student-engagement/tools-tips/raising-readers-what-parents-can-do\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/student-engagement/tools-tips/raising-readers-what-parents-can-do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same techniques</a></span> that make for effective reading at home.

It’s simple to use and lets you create some really impressive engineering feats. However, one thing I had a lot of trouble with is rotating items as I suspended them in the air. The game only lets you rotate things on the x and y axes, but because an item stays in the same position it was in when you use Ultrahand, it can sometimes be difficult to get its position right. I struggled with this for a few hours before realizing that pressing ZL while rotating resets the item’s orientation. You may still have to rotate it a bit on the axes, but it will make that process substantially easier.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h3732\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Constructs disappear if you reload your save</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Most of us put our Switches on standby mode when we step away from a game, but if you close out <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-88492050%23lnk%3Dsametab\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-88492050%23lnk%3Dsametab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span><em> </em>or save and reload, your Ultrahand-built constructs and their components will reset.

Near Rito Village, Link visits the Lucky Clover Gazette, Hyrule’s local paper, to investigate supposed sightings of Zelda, who has been missing in action since the game’s opening. There are two major advantages to doing this 12-part questline that make it worth bee-lining to. First, it has a pretty good reward in the Froggy armor set. This top, pants, and headpiece give Link some slip resistance, which makes it easier to climb surfaces when it’s raining.

But for a not-so-fun peek behind the curtain, I was the person who had an issue with this during the review period, prompting that announcement. When I first started <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s review build, I couldn’t save the game. I didn’t realize this until I was an hour in and lost a fight and realized I had no save to load. No hard saves, no autosaves. The issue only resolved after I went into my PC’s files and deleted every save from the early access period. So I can confirm, if you’ve played the early access version of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, <strong>delete all those saves</strong>. Like, now. If you’re reading this during your install, find those files and delete them.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The process for this might vary depending on your PC’s setup, but to do this, open your File Explorer and type %AppData% into the address bar.

Oftentimes I would run into a wall on a quest and didn’t feel like I was getting a lot of help from my journal as to what I should do next. Some of my earliest frustrations playing the RPG had me feeling like I’d lost all momentum on a questline because I couldn’t figure out the solution for something. I have a tendency to point beeline through RPG quests, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>has made me wrestle with those habits. It turns out that sometimes the best way to move forward is to simply go somewhere else and start another quest, rather than tunnel-visioning on one thing.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This is a good practice because it not only keeps you from getting stuck, but in several cases it can lead you to find solutions or helpful new context for quests other than the one you’re currently doing. That may be finding a new thing to do within a certain area or hub, or just learning something new about one of your party members while you’re on the other side of the world. When <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> throws walls up, turn around instead of beating your head against them. The quicker you recognize when your time is better spent elsewhere, the more you’ll actually accomplish in the world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90049\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>When traveling, just click on your destination</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">This mostly just applies to anyone playing on mouse and keyboard, but one thing I quickly picked up on during my travels is that it’s better to just click on your destination rather than micromanage your character’s movement when you’re trying to cross large distances. Clicking on a destination will have your character automatically find the path to that spot rather than you having to guide their every step. However, do be careful when you do this in dangerous areas, because in my experience, your character can walk through hazards without a care for their self-preservation. Click on a spot in a volcano and they will often take the path through the lava when a less direct approach and a well-placed jump could have avoided the burns entirely. So use your discretion when taking this approach, but in places like forests, towns, and camp, just clicking on where you’re going is the most efficient way to get around.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you’re playing with a controller on your PS5 or Xbox, you can access the point-and-click interface by pressing L3 (clicking in the left thumbstick on Xbox), which will give you a cursor to move across the map to choose your destination and have your character walk to it automatically. It might not feel as good as moving them with the analog stick, but it will let you map out your movement.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"654d612755e4178b3e9db6ada7174b6d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://654d612755e4178b3e9db6ada7174b6d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Minthara is shown standing at the edge of a cliff.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"654d612755e4178b3e9db6ada7174b6d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://654d612755e4178b3e9db6ada7174b6d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Minthara is shown standing at the edge of a cliff.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90050\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Push it real good</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">One of the lowkey best tools in your arsenal in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is shoving enemies during fights. As a bonus action, this won’t come at the expense of your attack each turn, and it lets you push enemies a pretty respectable distance. That’s handy for helping ranged characters get some distance so they can better use their bows or spells, but it also can be a secret one-hit kill depending on the arena you’re fighting in. Shoving a character off a high point will cause them to take fall damage, and in some cases, you can send someone plummeting to their death. Characters with high strength stats are best equipped to do this, but everyone can at least try to shove an enemy before any other action, and if the dice rolls in your favor, you can send someone down a chasm. This isn’t exclusive to grunts and lower-level enemies either. I cut a fight in half by shoving a boss down a hole in the second turn, leaving me to just clean up their lackeys. I saved myself so much time and so many supplies just by leading with a shove instead of a spell. So now, every time I enter a fight I’m looking for opportunities to push an enemy to their death like I’m Gerard Butler in <em>300</em>. Using abilities like Misty Step, which lets you teleport to a different spot on the map, can be real helpful in taking advantage of an enemy’s high ground.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90051\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>You don’t have to use long rest to see nighttime scenes</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">After a long day of getting beat up by wildlife and mind flayer lackeys, you’ll have to go back to camp to heal up. There are two options for this, the most ideal of which is called “long rest” which fully replenishes your health and spells. But doing this requires resources including food and supplies you’ve picked up on your journey. Each has a point value and if you have enough to reach 40 points, you’ll get to do a full rest. If not, you’ll do a partial rest which will only heal you up to the halfway point. This is pretty self-explanatory, but there’s an aspect to resting at camp that isn’t overtly explained: nighttime character moments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some nights, your party members will surprise you at night with a new scene that expands upon their relationship with you, as well as with each other. But you’ll have to actually rest to see them. However, if you’re trying to see one of these events, you don’t have to long rest to start the scene. So be mindful of whether or not you need to use your supplies when you’re trying to see more story content, because you can do a simple partial rest.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90052\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Flip the barter/sell toggle</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you find yourself talking to a merchant and looking to get rid of some of the junk you’ve picked up on your travels, know that the game doesn’t default to you selling those items. Instead, it drops you into the bartering system. This means you can make a trade for some items with no monetary cost to either yourself or the merchant, but if you’re looking to get gold instead of more nonsense to carry around, you’ll need to toggle to selling your stuff instead of trading it. There’s a switch you can flip at the top of the screen, but it can be easy to miss if you just immediately start throwing junk into the barter slot with reckless abandon. So just be sure you know what you’re actually doing before you start loading up your cart.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9aa475cbfce780e6a569d341cb4d698f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9aa475cbfce780e6a569d341cb4d698f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A hero and Lae\'zel are seen looking at the aftermath of a battle, including a person shot in the back with an arrow.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9aa475cbfce780e6a569d341cb4d698f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9aa475cbfce780e6a569d341cb4d698f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A hero and Lae\'zel are seen looking at the aftermath of a battle, including a person shot in the back with an arrow.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90053\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Sometimes switching your player character is the best approach</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s eclectic party members come from different backgrounds and have different proficiencies, and as a result, sometimes one of your companions is just better suited for a situation than your created avatar. I’m playing as a human warlock, and while he’s spec’d to excel in charisma checks, sometimes that’s not enough. Another character’s background and expertise on certain stats can make them the ideal person to take the lead on a problem. Once, I switched control to Lae’zel, the Githyanki warrior with a connection to others of her race that my human character couldn’t overcome on dice rolls alone. Other times, characters will be able to pass a perception check or a religion check that makes them better suited to do things as simple as examine an object in the world and provide context my character can’t. So if you’re missing certain checks, try swapping to another character in your party and seeing if they notice something you don’t.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90054\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The Attack of Opportunity is your friend and foe</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">One of the passive reaction abilities every character has is called the Attack of Opportunity. This allows you (and your foes) to automatically attack an enemy that is moving out of close-quarters attack range for free. This is something to be cognizant of for yourself, as enemies getting up in your face means guaranteed damage even on your own turns if you try to move away from them. One way to handle this is the previously mentioned Shove ability, which will push them out of Attack of Opportunity range so you’re free to move away safely. But it also can be a strategic play to position your characters close to enemies, long-ranged ones especially, so they get caught up in the area of effect. If you do this against an archer or spellcaster, odds are they will try to move away from your character out of necessity, as their accuracy goes down if they’re too close. So even if you can’t take them out in one turn, just having your character in their proximity can score you some free damage.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"9aee158785a61496bece7115890e01ed\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9aee158785a61496bece7115890e01ed\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Baldur\'s Gate 3 dice roll shows successful stat check.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"9aee158785a61496bece7115890e01ed\" data-recommend-id=\"image://9aee158785a61496bece7115890e01ed\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Baldur\'s Gate 3 dice roll shows successful stat check.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90055\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Weapon efficiency is determined by the character examining it</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Something it took me a few hours to realize is that, because I was hoarding all my loot with my warlock character, I would see the prospective stats for a sword or an axe and think it wasn’t anything impressive because the numbers it showed in the menu were reflective of his stats, which don’t prioritize strength. See, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> tells you weapon stats based on the character whose inventory it’s in. If I took a sword from my character’s inventory and moved it to Lae’zel or Karlach, who are geared toward those kinds of weapons, I’d see much higher numbers because it was then taking into account those party members’ stats to give me a new, higher projected damage output. So if you’re looking to see if you should change a character’s loadout, move it to their inventory instead of someone who wouldn’t use it to begin with.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90056\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>The word is mightier than the sword, spell, fist, etc.</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">I love talking my way out of shit in RPGs, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>is no exception. When I made my warlock character, I spec’d hard into charisma, intimidation, deception, persuasion, and anything that would give me an edge in dialogue checks. There are so many combat scenarios I was able to circumvent with a silver tongue, and it kinda rules. The combat is great, but there’s just something so nice about talking out the ass and saving all those supplies, HP, and time, and honestly, I’ve dumped so many points into these attributes that it can kind of feel OP. I can’t think of many rolls I’ve missed on dialogue checks because I’ve pretty much ensured I’ll always have enough points at the end of each one. But for when I do need some help on that front…</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90057\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Shadowheart’s Guidance is too good to not have at all times</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Shadowheart, the party’s resident cleric and racist, has an ability called Guidance, which gives you an additional d4 bonus to ability checks both in battle and in dialogue. In dialogue checks, this can be applied to every dice roll, which means you will always have a buff to whatever you roll with no downside. There’s zero reason for you not to use it every time a check pops up, which means Shadowheart has become a mainstay in my party. Sure, she has healing spells right out the gate and can pack a decent punch, but I keep her around so she can make my numbers go up every time. Here’s hoping she unlearns her prejudice against Githyanki, because I’m already tired of that shit.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"44fd9b5a75c4ae95b7ecbc2454979f8b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://44fd9b5a75c4ae95b7ecbc2454979f8b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A hero and Shadowheart are seen looking at something on the ground.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"44fd9b5a75c4ae95b7ecbc2454979f8b\" data-recommend-id=\"image://44fd9b5a75c4ae95b7ecbc2454979f8b\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A hero and Shadowheart are seen looking at something on the ground.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90058\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Destroy alarms and war drums as quickly as you can</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Alongside looking for shoving opportunities, one of the first things you should do in a combat encounter is be on the lookout for war drums or other kinds of alarms that your opponents might be able to use to bring in reinforcements. If you spot these quickly, you can destroy them at range with a well-placed arrow or long-range spell. If, on the other hand, you don’t destroy them in time, you’ll have a whole ‘nother squad headed your way in a turn or two.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90059\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Ranged characters need high ground or they’re not going to be useful</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>is pretty upfront with how positioning, whether that be distance or elevation, is key to some attacks’ effectiveness. Sometimes a spell or arrow will still land if you’re on low ground or close to an enemy, but by default, you should be working toward getting your spellcasters and ranged fighters to high ground. These characters are typically not the tanky types you want hanging out with the brawlers on the ground floor anyway, so distance and high ground are always your friends for your ranged heroes.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h90060\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use your Illithid abilities sparingly</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The mind-altering tadpoles in your party’s head come with a perk that lets you influence other characters with relative ease, but there are some drawbacks to using them without any kind of forethought. For one, you only get one of them a day before you do a long rest. So influencing some lowlife bandit is probably not the most economic use of this limited ability. If you want to go down this potentially dangerous path, whipping out one of your most finite resources with no regard for what it will cost is not the move.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">But also, do you really want to use this dangerous weapon threatening your life? If, by using it, you become dependent on it, are you not failing in your quest to save yourself and your friends from its clutches? What if, by the end, you’ve used it so much that it easily takes over your mind and transforms you into a tentacled monster? I mean, unless you’re into that. You do you, booboo.</p>', '2024-01-10 18:27:01', '2024-01-10 18:27:01', '14 Things To Know Before Starting Baldur’s Gate 3', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/4885c80b8576e042feab770433425f1f.jpg', 'game-tips', 'https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-tips-save-file-abilities-builds-party-1850704861', '  Baldur’s Gate 3 has become a cultural phenomenon in 2023.

But in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, they’re not quite as useful as they once were, because a different currency is far more effective at giving you what gold coins do.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Check Out <em>Super Mario Bros.

Because of this, and because traditionally, <em>Mario </em>games can get pretty damn tough at times, players have often gone out of their way to grab as many of them as possible in order to stock up on lives and never have to worry about a game over. However, in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, there’s a new set of purple Flower Coins that act as a currency for shops you’ll find in the Flower Kingdom. These aren’t quite as abundant as the gold coins Mario’s been collecting for decades, but if you’re looking for lives, these are easily the more sensible option.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you head to any of the shops you find on the overworld map, you’ll find 20 purple Flower Coins net you five lives, rather than the measly one you’ll get for collecting 100 gold coins. I wish I’d realized this early on, because I wasted some precious time using the new Elephant Mushroom powerup to sprinkle the ground with water and get a few extra gold coins from the flowers on the ground, when I should’ve been looking for Flower Coins, instead.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"84c2c376d5c3a54953ae6ca2c629cd12\" data-recommend-id=\"image://84c2c376d5c3a54953ae6ca2c629cd12\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Luigi stands facing a hidden 10-point purple coin in a hidden area.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"84c2c376d5c3a54953ae6ca2c629cd12\" data-recommend-id=\"image://84c2c376d5c3a54953ae6ca2c629cd12\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Luigi stands facing a hidden 10-point purple coin in a hidden area.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h99970\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Where are purple Flower Coins in <em>Super Mario Bros.

The most prominent are individual ones you’ll often find mixed in with gold coins or hidden in blocks you’ll need to break. But you’ll also find a few larger ones valued at 10 coins scattered throughout most levels, often hidden behind a puzzle, secret area, or a level-shifting Wonder Flower. There are typically three of these bigger coins in a stage, and if you’ve found them before, you can’t go back and get them again. But they are a high-value collectible that make it worth exploring levels to their fullest, both for completionist reasons and because they actually give you something tangible in return.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"209f1462610e76b5b9d5d58580d96f0f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://209f1462610e76b5b9d5d58580d96f0f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Wonder shop shows multiple items up for sale.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"209f1462610e76b5b9d5d58580d96f0f\" data-recommend-id=\"image://209f1462610e76b5b9d5d58580d96f0f\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A Wonder shop shows multiple items up for sale.\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h99971\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>If I already have plenty of lives, what can purple Flower Coins get me?</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Lives aren’t the only things merchants sell in <em>Super Mario Bros.

It’s super quiet, so the controller would need to be, like, an inch or so from your ear. But despite it not housing an actual speaker, the Pro Controller still sings for you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">According to Hidden Gaming Deals, Nintendo programmed the controller’s vibrations to sound like music. So while it’s not putting out an orchestral tune for you, as it might were it the PS5\'s literally all-singing DualSense, it instead ingeniously emits a facsimile of notes that give the impression of music. <em>Kotaku</em> tested this too, and can confirm that yep, DJ Mario is making bops in the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller lounge. It’s sick, especially if you can get precise with the platforming to structure a real song.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-reviews-switch-1850937230\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-reviews-switch-1850937230\"><em>Super Mario Bros.

Once you get the little city skyscraper icon with the green arrows filled in, you can fast travel to any point in that section of the map.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The system is so quick and seamless that if you’re already swinging or flying with your wingsuit your momentum will continue on in the new location.

Midtown is the most central, and worth unlocking first. Williamsburg, Downtown Queens, and Harlem are also worth prioritizing. But don’t rely on fast travel too much. <em>Spider-Man 2</em> is still at its best when you’re swinging down big boulevards and exploring the massive city for yourself.</p>', '2024-01-10 18:42:01', '2024-01-10 18:42:01', 'How To Unlock Fast Travel In Spider-Man 2', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/23787c879ea44522fc37c46ef5d76556.jpg', 'game-tips', 'https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-how-to-unlock-fast-travel-ps5-guide-1850939716', 'Spider-Man 2’s New York city sandbox is bigger than ever, with the addition of Q...', NULL);

And you should do that! We recommended improving your max health and damage output first. Fights in <em>Spider-Man 2</em> tend to be bigger and last longer than in the first game and being able to take extra hits and punch goons harder will come in handy.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101004\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Use your wingsuit!</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Swinging around New York is a blast, I get it, so why would you ever think about using your wings to glide? Well, because using the wings is also very fun! But more importantly, you can cover a lot of ground while gliding, especially if you take advantage of the various wind tunnels spread across the city. The wingsuit comes in especially handy as you’re crossing the East River or exploring the lower-rise areas of Brooklyn and Queens.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101005\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Try the 40fps mode</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Spider-Man 2</em> has a lot of visual options to tinker with, including ray-tracing and various modes. Normally for console games, your choices are 60fps or 30fps. But if you own a 120hz TV, Insomniac has included a 40fps mode that delivers a smoother presentation than 30fps, but retains all the fancy visual details and graphical settings. I played a few hours in this mode and enjoyed it.<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">And if you are curious as to why 40fps works so well, but only on a 120hz display, check out this <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-why-ratchet-and-clank-rift-aparts-40fps-fidelity-mode-is-a-potential-game-changer\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-why-ratchet-and-clank-rift-aparts-40fps-fidelity-mode-is-a-potential-game-changer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Digital Foundry</em> write-up about <em>Ratchet and Clank</em>’s 40fps mode</a></span> for all the details.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"f8c7e1cad45a772e2a3ce7dd4a15e674\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f8c7e1cad45a772e2a3ce7dd4a15e674\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Kraven the Hunter in Spider-Man 2. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"f8c7e1cad45a772e2a3ce7dd4a15e674\" data-recommend-id=\"image://f8c7e1cad45a772e2a3ce7dd4a15e674\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows Kraven the Hunter in Spider-Man 2. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101006\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Don’t focus on side content at the start</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Look, it’s fun to swing (and glide!) around NYC. I get it. And you might be tempted to start knocking out all the side stuff or taking down random criminals across the city right from the start. Instead, we suggest focusing on the main campaign for a bit to unlock more abilities, side content, and collectibles.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101007\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>But don’t wait until the very end, either</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Lots of repeating icons throughout the map—like Sandman’s crystals and the Forgotten Flame cult break-ins—slowly build toward a narrative conclusion as you complete them. These are far more satisfying if you haven’t already completed the main story. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Catching Kraven’s drones and completing all of his hideouts are especially worth completing mid-game because they help build out his character’s backstory and motivations in more interesting ways.<br></p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101008\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>SLINGSHOT TIME!</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Slingshot Launch is an exhilarating new way to get some momentum quickly and cover large distances. Hold L2+X anywhere to start the slingshot move and then release to go flying into the sky. While you can do this practically anywhere, we recommend slingin’ off the top of a tall building for maximum effectiveness.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101009\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Web shooters are your friend</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">It’s very simple. ABC: always be cobwebbing. Your web shooters can slow enemies down, temporarily disarm them, or stick them to walls. Don’t forget to keep spamming the R1 button in-between punching and web-swinging to get the most out of your web shooters.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101010\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Upgrade the web grabber gadget</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The Web Grabber is one of the best tools in the game. It ensnares groups of enemies and pulls them into a big pile, which is incredibly handy for crowd control and setting up combos. It can be upgraded to grab objects and big baddies, too, clearing whole waves of enemies in a cinch.<br></p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"b8fc9273df746aa256d9412e2b867328\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b8fc9273df746aa256d9412e2b867328\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows a blue glowing chest in Spider-Man 2. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"b8fc9273df746aa256d9412e2b867328\" data-recommend-id=\"image://b8fc9273df746aa256d9412e2b867328\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows a blue glowing chest in Spider-Man 2. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101011\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Keep an eye (and ear) open for blue and yellow tech crates</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Dotted across the Big Apple are blue and yellow boxes that contain resources you’ll need to upgrade gadgets, suit tech and craft new costumes. Why are these boxes here? The game explains that. But regardless, if you compulsively collected every orb in <em>Crackdown</em>, this will feel very similar in a good way. To help locate these crates, listen for pinging and keep an eye out for bright blue or yellow lights on top of buildings or in alleyways. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101012\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Spread out skill points between both Spider-Men</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">While you can usually switch between the two heroes whenever you want, there are portions of the game where this isn’t possible. Likewise, most missions and sidequests require you to use a specific Spider-Man. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So don’t lump all your points into one. <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-skills-abilities-upgrade-guide-peter-miles-1850939701\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-skills-abilities-upgrade-guide-peter-miles-1850939701\">Try to upgrade both of them, as well as the shared skills</a></span>, so neither Spidey is lacking.

By the end of that game, Uncle Aaron has realized the error of his ways (after his nephew beat his ass) and turns himself in to the authorities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">If you want to see what happens next, you need to complete all the Prowler Stash puzzles in NYC.

Sure, you can ignore this mechanic at first, as early on the game throws enemies at you who don’t hit too hard and can be taken out quickly. But later on, you’ll need to parry to survive intense boss fights and bigger combat encounters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">So instead of fumbling in the later parts as you try to master parrying, practice right away on weaker enemies and get the timing down.</p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101017\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Give yourself a challenge and push the difficulty up to Amazing</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The game can start to get unbalanced as you begin unlocking more powers and accumulating upgrades, especially in the second half. If you’re clearing out most of the side missions before finishing the game, it’s not a bad idea to push the difficulty up to the hardest setting to keep things interesting. It’ll help to keep you from button-mashing your way to the end.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101018\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Don’t be afraid to skip puzzles or get free health in boss fights</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><em>Spider-Man 2</em>’s accessibility options in the gameplay settings let you auto-refill your health when it hits zero and completely bypass certain puzzles in the game if they just aren’t clicking for you. If you get stuck, use them. The game’s more fun that way.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101019\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Die in boss fights to reset useful environmental traps</strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Some boss fights can feature multiple stages and take quite a long time to finish. One trick that can help is if you purposely die after reaching a checkpoint in a fight. This will fill your health without using Focus bars and reset traps in the boss fight arena, which is very useful when fighting certain tougher enemies.<br></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 dezcon\" id=\"h101020\">\n<a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a><strong>Tall buildings are your best friends</strong><br>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">With the new wingsuit, you can jump off New York’s tallest skyscrapers and glide for miles. Once you’ve unlocked fast travel for various parts of the city, you can immediately hop over to them, climb up, and take off to cover lots of ground quickly while looking for collectibles like Spider-Bots. </p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Oscorp Tower on the Upper West Side, the Avengers Tower in Midtown, and Freedom Tower in the Financial District are the best ones.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"><strong>Pre-order <em>Marvel’s</em> <em>Spider-Man 2:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\"[]\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MARVELS-SPIDER-MAN-2-Launch-PlayStation-5/dp/B0C7WNMCSC/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-ps5-tips-tricks-help-guide-spoiler-free-1850941904&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\" data-amazonasin=\"B0C7WNMCSC\" data-amazontag=\"kinjakotakulink-20\">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://howl.me/ckNSbfvKnwD\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://howl.me/ckNSbfvKnwD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 erKGZM js_link\" data-ga=\'[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fmarvels-spider-man-2-launch-edition---playstation-5%2F394826.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]\' href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fmarvels-spider-man-2-launch-edition---playstation-5%2F394826.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim\" data-vtas-click=\"self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody\">GameStop</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\"> .<br></p>', '2024-01-10 18:47:01', '2024-01-10 18:47:01', '19 Things We Wish We Knew About Spider-Man 2 Before We Started', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/a5f75df268a6a39095335301b1d3ae8e.jpg', 'game-tips', 'https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-ps5-tips-tricks-help-guide-spoiler-free-1850941904', 'After years of hype and numerous teasers, Spider-Man 2 is finally here.

Instead of just pulling in nearby enemies, it will also grab barrels, cinder blocks, and other throwables in the vicinity, dealing extra damage. As you progress through the game, a well-placed Grabber deployment can occasionally knock out an entire squad of enemies all by itself. All you need for this powerful upgrade is 155 Tech Parts (earned by preventing crimes) and 3 City Tokens (earned from collecting Marko’s Memories and completing Photo Ops). </p>\n\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"1e5183eb7c3ec5d0afc288405d5a949d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1e5183eb7c3ec5d0afc288405d5a949d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows the gadget menu for the Web Grabber. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"1e5183eb7c3ec5d0afc288405d5a949d\" data-recommend-id=\"image://1e5183eb7c3ec5d0afc288405d5a949d\" data-format=\"jpg\" data-width=\"3840\" data-height=\"2160\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"A screenshot shows the gadget menu for the Web Grabber. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The rest of the Web Grabber’s upgrades make it even more of a standout, increasing the range, the number of enemies pulled in, and allowing it to affect larger enemies as well. For those upgrades you’ll also need Rare Tech Parts (earned from completing Prowler Stashes and EMF Experiments) and Hero Tokens (earned from completing Hunter Bases and Mysteriums).<br></p>\n\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">From there, it’s a good idea to focus on upgrading your standard Web-Shooters since they’re your number-one defense against enemies; you can quickly and easily subdue many mooks after just a few punches by sticking them to nearby surfaces. The first two upgrades are the most crucial, since they increase your charge count and how fast they refill.</p>\n<figure class=\"sc-1eow4w5-1 fuSEnv align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure\" data-id=\"54590af893478af711e1b9558f99a867\" data-recommend-id=\"image://54590af893478af711e1b9558f99a867\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Peter uses the Web Grabber on enemies while wearing the black costume. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n<span data-id=\"54590af893478af711e1b9558f99a867\" data-recommend-id=\"image://54590af893478af711e1b9558f99a867\" data-format=\"gif\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"450\" data-lightbox=\"true\" data-alt=\"Peter uses the Web Grabber on enemies while wearing the black costume. \" data-recommended=\"false\" data-hide=\"false\" class=\"js_recommend\"></span></figure>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">Concussion Burst grenades, meanwhile, become <em>very</em> useful later on. They temporarily stun rank-and-file enemies, but are especially effective against Venom when it comes to confrontations in the back half of the game. While it’s not necessary to prioritize them right from the start, it’s a good idea to have all five of their upgrades maxed out by the third act. You’ll understand why once you get there.<br></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv\">The other two gadgets are frankly<em> fine</em>. It’s worth putting at least one point into upgrading the Upshot and Ricochet Web when you have the tokens to spare, but I personally didn’t find them to drastically change the odds when I got into a tight spot. Still, more toys to throw at goons equals more fun, and since <em>Spider-Man 2</em> is a game built to be 100 percented, you’ll probably find yourself upgrading them eventually anyway. </p>', '2024-01-11 06:22:01', '2024-01-11 06:22:01', 'Make Sure To Upgrade These Gadgets First In Spider-Man 2', 'https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/26b72890c0f91c1247b37510418b2085.jpg', 'game-tips', 'https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-gadgets-upgrade-guide-ps5-1850939665', 'Spider-Man 2 quickly gives you an overwhelming arsenal of skills and abilities t...', NULL);

The PS5 version enhances these mechanics with new haptic feedback and controller speaker features.</p>\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UC0hhcMKTNQ\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Immortality’s unsettling atmosphere, inventive mechanics, and strong storytelling earned it a place on <em>Game Informer</em>’s Top 10 Games of 2022.

INSERT INTO `ch_gather` VALUES (134, NULL, '<p>Since its release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last February, developer Avalanche\'s Hogwarts Legacy has continued to sell well. It has maintained the top position almost every month for best-selling games in the U.S., too. Thanks to a new interview at <em>Variety </em>with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad, we now know Hogwarts Legacy has surpassed 22 million copies sold and it did so in less than a year. </p>\n\n<p>Haddad told <em>Variety </em>that Hogwarts Legacy crossed the 22 million mark at the end of 2023, picking up 2 million alone in December. He says it\'s the best-selling game of the year \"in the entire industry worldwide.\" Typically, that title goes to a Call of Duty or other triple-A release. </p>\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtyBjOW8sGY\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>\"But it\'s not just the unit sold that I\'m so proud of, it\'s just that it delighted the fans so much,\" Haddad tells the publication. \"It brought Harry Potter to life in a new way for gamers where they could be themselves in this world, in this story. And that\'s what the team at Avalanche set out to do when they were developing the game and I think that\'s really why it resonated so well and remains the best-selling game of the year in the entire industry worldwide.\" </p>\n\n<p>Hogwarts Legacy was also the top trending search for games on Google in 2023. While many players were likely searching for new trailers, gameplay, and guides for the game, there\'s no doubt some of the Google searching for the game stemmed from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling\'s inflammatory statements about the trans community. Publisher Warner Bros. Interactive says Rowling was not involved with the creation of Hogwarts Legacy, which was developed by Avalanche, but given it\'s based on the Harry Potter franchise she created, she undoubtedly made money off of it.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in <em>Variety\'s </em>report, Haddad touches on something Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav told shareholders during the company\'s Q3 earnings call in November of last year. During it, Zaslav said the company\'s gaming focus is on transforming its biggest franchises from largely console and PC with 3-to-4-year release schedules to include \"more always-on gameplay through live services, multi-platform, and free-to-play extensions with the goal to have more players spending more time on more platforms,\" according to <em>Variety</em>​​​​​​. </p>\n\n<p>Haddad told <em>Variety </em>that to achieve that, it needs to accumulate \"live games launched with new content, keeping our mobile games services vibrant, and large launching new content.\" Notably, Hogwarts Legacy is not a live-service game, nor does it feature any multiplayer components. It is a single-player game, and the best-selling game of 2023, according to its publisher. </p>\n\n<p>However, Warner Bros. will soon dive into the world of live-service games when Batman Arkham trilogy developer Rocksteady releases its multiplayer third-person shooter Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League on February 2. </p>\n\n<p>For more about Hogwarts Legacy and Warner Bros.\'s wider gaming plans, be sure to read <em>Variety\'s </em>full report here. </p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><i>Were you one of the 22 million people who bought Hogwarts Legacy last year?

INSERT INTO `ch_gather` VALUES (143, NULL, '<p>CD Projekt Red is one of the biggest developers in Europe, but the studio behind The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 has no interest in being acquired. That comes from a new interview with the studio’s CEO, Adam Kiciński, who discusses acquisition possibilities while providing small updates on the studio’s litany of upcoming projects.</p><p>Speaking to the Polish outlet <em>Parkiet</em>, Kiciński was asked about rumors regarding the studio being a target of a takeover. He states via translation, “We are not interested in being included in any larger entity. We have worked our whole lives to get to the position we have now. And we believe that in a few years we will be even bigger and stronger. We have ambitious plans and we are passionate about what we do. We value independence.”</p><p>In turn, Kiciński also states CD Projekt Red is currently uninterested in buying another studio purely for the sake of having it to, in his words, “consolidate their financial results.” In October 2021, the studio acquired Molasses Flood, the developer of The Flame in the Flood and Drake Hollow. That studio is currently working on a game set in the Witcher universe codenamed “Sirius.” </p><p>Kicińsk also provides small updates on its portfolio of upcoming Witcher and Cyberpunk games as well as its new IP. He states that work on the next mainline Witcher game, codenamed “Polaris,” is in “full swing” and has around 330 employees, which will rise to 400 by later this year. </p><p>“Orion,” the codename for the next Cyberpunk game, has been in the conceptual stage for some time, and the development team is still being assembled. It will primarily be made from CD Projekt Red’s Boston studio and eventually expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. </p><p>Kicińsk then briefly touches on project “Hadar,” which is a new IP that is currently in the conceptual phase. When asked what Hadar is, Kicińsk simply says, “I assure you that it will be an interesting pop culture concept, fitting both The Witcher and Cyberpunk.”</p><p>CD Projekt Red will spend 2024 chipping away at these games and is riding a wave of positive momentum following the successful launch of Cyberpunk 2077\'s Phantom Liberty expansion and other big updates the game received.

INSERT INTO `ch_gather` VALUES (144, NULL, '<p>On January 1, <em>Steamboat Willie</em>, the cartoon that introduced the world to Mickey Mouse, entered the public domain, meaning the first version of Disney’s iconic mascot is (mostly) free to use by anyone. And just like when the film <em>Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey</em> took advantage of that whimsical character entering the public domain, someone has already started making a twisted, horrifying version of Mickey. In this case, it’s a video game.</p>\n\n<p>It’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games. The game is an episodic four-player co-op survival adventure in which players control exterminators tasked with killing mutated vermin – and one of them happens to be a terrifying, person-sized monster modeled after Mickey. Similar to games like Phasmophobia and Lethal Company, you’ll rely on various tools and surveillance equipment to track the source of the infestations before neutralizing them. You’ll also have to maintain power for certain pieces of equipment while evading the giant, murderous rodents.  </p>\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qe85jZhSflk\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The game was announced on New Year’s Day but has already courted some controversy. It was originally titled Infestation 88 (as seen in the trailer) until it received blowback online for its perceived ties to Neo-Nazis (88 is a common dogwhistle), among other references in the trailer. Nightmare Forge Games quickly denied this and issued a statement to <em>IGN</em>  saying it was unaware of the reference and apologizing for any unintentional endorsement of Neo-Nazis, explaining the title referred to the game’s late 1980s setting. The team states:</p>\n\n<p>“We want to apologize for our ignorance on this topic and appreciate that it was brought to our attention so we could address it. There is no intentional use of Nazi symbolism in our game nor studio, and we\'ll continue to address any concerns as they arise. We strongly stand against Nazism and hate in any form.\"</p>\n\n<p>Outlets such as <em>Motherboard</em> have also pointed out red flags indicating the game could be shovelware, such as its apparent use of asset flipping (via the Unity store) and AI-generated text-to-speech voice work. “As an indie studio, we do rely on some purchased assets from the Unreal and Unity stores,” Nightmare Forge Games told <em>Motherboard</em>. “However, there is a lot of work going into this project that we’re hopeful will be evident upon release.” The developer states the AI voiceovers in particular are placeholders and plans to hire real voice actors in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Following the failure of similarly slapped together games like The Day Before, curious players should perhaps approach Infestation: Origins with some degree of caution. Infestation: Origins is coming to PC via Steam and will first launch in Early Access sometime this year.</p>', '2024-01-11 11:45:55', '2024-01-11 11:45:55', 'Someone Is Already Making A Steamboat Willie Mickey Mouse Horror Game', 'https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser_promoted_image_thumbnail_mobile_/public/2024/01/03/61fcbeba/infestationorigins1.jpg', 'news', 'https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/03/someone-is-already-making-a-steamboat-willie-mickey-mouse-horror-game', 'That didn\'t take long.', NULL);

That was the greatest part of the whole thing, honestly, Seinfeld tells <em>Empire</em> of Grants casting. Because I am a crazy fan of his. For the first time in 30 years, Grant filmed an audition tape for Seinfeld, the comedy legend who stars, writes, and is director on <em>Unfrosted</em>. [Hugh] asked me if it matters that Tony the Tiger has a British accent. I told him, No, who cares?

Seinfeld himself plays a Kelloggs boss, and hell be joined on screen by the likes of Melissa McCarthy, Amy Schumer, Dan Levy, James Marsden and Christian Slater. Everybody I asked said yes, so we ended up with this crazy cast, he tells <em>Empire</em>.

Take Immortan Joe, who couldnt sound more of a self-made ferocious warlord. Or Imperator Furiosa, clearly an absolute force of vengeance. Then theres the hard-rocking Doof Warrior, or Lord Humungus from <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/empire-essay-mad-max-2-review/\" target=\"_blank\">The Road Warrior</a></em>. Or what about Rictus Erectus, who well, well leave that to the imagination. So when you learn that Chris Hemsworths character in <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/furiosa-trailer-brings-anya-taylor-joy-to-george-millers-mad-max-saga/\" target=\"_blank\">Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</a></em>  George Millers sprawling <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/mad-max-fury-road-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Fury Road</a></em> prequel  goes by the moniker Dementus, its already clear: hes probably not a sunshine and rainbows kind of guy.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>That hunch would be absolutely correct. Hes a pretty horrible individual, Hemsworth tells <em>Empire</em> in the world-exclusive <em>Furiosa</em> issue. But like all the best baddies, he doesnt necessarily think of himself that way. Through the whole film we kept coming back to, This is evil, but what is the intention behind it? Its not just sadistic insanity. There is a real purpose, the wheels are turning, hes plotting and planning and ten steps ahead of everyone else. Amid the harshness of the Wasteland, he even imagines himself as something of a father figure to Furiosa, here <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/furiosa-mad-max-saga-15-year-story-odyssey-anya-taylor-joy-exclusive/\" target=\"_blank\">played by Anya Taylor-Joy</a>.

[Furiosa] would, Im sure, argue to her death the complete opposite.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>A guy named Dementus in the <em>Mad Max</em> world demands a suitably ludicrous set of wheels  and on that front, filmmaker George Miller was happy to oblige. The chariot bike is the wildest piece of machinery Ive ever driven, and I loved every second of it, Hemsworth raves, teasing more gigantic revved-up action this time around. I mean, hanging off a crane at one point and being loaded onto a monster truck, and then on the monster truck someone unclips me off a harness and the truck spins away into a burnout. How this world comes from one of the kindest individuals, Ill never know Its like they say: you dont have to be as mad as Max to work here  but it helps.</p>\n</span><div class=\"inlineImage_image-container__aklxu block-item\" data-test=\"inline-image-container\"><img alt=\"Empire  May 2024  Furiosa newsstand cover\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" style=\"position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\' %3E%3Cfilter id=\'b\' color-interpolation-filters=\'sRGB\'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=\'1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1\' result=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeFlood x=\'0\' y=\'0\' width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\'/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=\'out\' in=\'s\'/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=\'SourceGraphic\'/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\'20\'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=\'100%25\' height=\'100%25\' x=\'0\' y=\'0\' preserveAspectRatio=\'none\' style=\'filter: url(%23b);\' href=\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mO8/B8AAqsB1DKTUZgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw,(max-width: 992px) 66vw,50vw\" srcset=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/03/empmay24-furiosa-mad-max-newsstand-cover.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=384&amp;q=80 384w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/03/empmay24-furiosa-mad-max-newsstand-cover.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=480&amp;q=80 480w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/03/empmay24-furiosa-mad-max-newsstand-cover.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=768&amp;q=80 768w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/03/empmay24-furiosa-mad-max-newsstand-cover.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=992&amp;q=80 992w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/03/empmay24-furiosa-mad-max-newsstand-cover.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1200&amp;q=80 1200w, https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/03/empmay24-furiosa-mad-max-newsstand-cover.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80 1440w\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/03/empmay24-furiosa-mad-max-newsstand-cover.jpg?auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"></div>\n<span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Read <em>Empire</em>s <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/empire-world-exclusive-furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-covers-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\">world-exclusive <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> cover</a> feature  delving into the guzzoline-fuelled madness of the action-packed shoot, with George Miller, Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth and more  in the May 2024 issue, on sale Thursday 14 March. <a href=\"https://www.greatmagazines.co.uk/empire-may-2024?utm_source=dynamic&amp;utm_medium=bws&amp;utm_campaign=empire_singles&amp;utm_content=empiremay2024\" rel=\"noopener\">Pre-order a copy online here</a>. <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> comes to UK cinemas from 24 May.</p>\n</span>', '2024-03-11 17:17:32', '2024-03-11 17:17:32', 'Furiosa: Chris Hemsworths Warlord Dementus Is A Pretty Horrible Individual, He Says  Exclusive', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/03/chris-dem-header.png?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/furiosa-chris-hemsworth-dementus-pretty-horrible-individual-exclusive/', 'When you hear the name of a character in the Mad Max universe, you instantly...', 'news');

There was the unhinged action, with mind-bending car-based carnage that put pedal to the metal. Then there was the intensity of the filmmaking itself, channeling Maxs own madness into a jolt of cinematic adrenaline. But its secret weapon came in a different form  not Tom Hardys Max, but another lone figure in the water-sparse Wasteland who, with her buzzcut, blackened brow, and biomechanical arm, immediately became a cinematic icon. Her name was Imperator Furiosa, and she set the screen ablaze. Now, shes about to take centre stage in this summers wildest blockbuster  buckle up for <em><a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/furiosa-trailer-brings-anya-taylor-joy-to-george-millers-mad-max-saga/\" target=\"_blank\">Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</a></em>.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Millers long-awaited prequel sees Anya Taylor-Joy take over the role originated by Charlize Theron in <em>Fury Road</em>. And theres good reason for that  not only is it does it delve into the characters history, but it takes place over a significant swathe of her life. The story is the saga of Furiosa, and how she gets taken from home, and spends the rest of her life trying to get back, Miller tells <em>Empire</em>, in our world-exclusive <em>Furiosa</em> cover feature. [In] <em>Fury Road</em>, the story unfolds over three days and two nights. This film follows the story that runs directly into <em>Fury Road</em>, for 15 years. Even for long-time <em>Mad Max</em> fans, its going to be a unique and unexpected ride. Its a different animal, explains Miller. Its got many different locations. Its an odyssey. No question.</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>Originally penned as part of the process of working towards <em>Fury Road</em>, the <em>Furiosa</em> screenplay proved an instant hit with Theron when she perused it as preparation for shooting <em>Mad Max</em>. She said, Please, George, can we make this first? laughs Miller. It was the first time I realised that theres something really strong in this story. But its Anya Taylor-Joy taking the wheel here, with Therons blessing. Shes been so classy and kind in letting me go and do it, Taylor-Joy tells <em>Empire</em>, noting that shes yet to meet with her fellow Furiosa face-to-face. But I feel very lucky that, from the second I read the script, I just knew this person. I felt so fiercely protective over Furiosa, and fiercely protective of her interests. Her only disappointment? Not being allowed to get the clippers out to achieve Furiosas famous do, owing to the shooting schedule. I was so excited to shave my head, she says. Then George saw me in real life, and went, No, we cant!</p>\n</span><span class=\"content_content__i0P3p\" data-test=\"content\">\n<p>As with <em>Fury Road</em>, <em>Furiosa</em> will pitch her into a world of warring men  not just the returning Immortan Joe, but Chris Hemsworths warlord Dementus, and Tom Burkes War Rig driver Praetorian Jack. And while this is Furiosas story through and through, its still a Mad Max Saga  not necessarily precluding some kind of appearance from the man himself.

Directed by Niki Caro and starring Liu Yifei, Jet Li and Gong Li, its a big budget, special effects rich, star-studded blockbuster. In our review, we praised it as not only the best live-action Disney adaptation to date, but also a dazzling, moving, hair-prickling spectacle. And now you can enjoy Mulan from the comfort of your own sofa (or bed were not judging) when you unlock Disney+ Premier Access for an additional fee of 19.99. </em> Like the 1998 animated Disney favourite, this film follows the tale of Mulan (Liu Yifei), who disguises herself as man to take her the place of her father (Tzi Ma) in the army after the Emperor (Jet Li) conscripts one man from every family to fight against an invading army. In this retelling, we are introduced to two new baddies Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), who both come with back stories of hurt and vengeance. &nbsp;One of the things that makes this film such a blockbuster is the extraordinary battle scenes. Specialist stunt teams were brought in from China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, New Zealand and Australia to train and choreograph the lead actors and an army of 100 extras. The team also studied numerous styles of martial arts, assigning armies and characters with their own forms of movement. Characters such as Mulan, Commander Tung and Xian Lang have a fighting style inspired by the grace and fluidity of Tai Chi and Wushu, whereas the Imperial Army were trained with an ancient military precision. &nbsp;This sweeping film came to life across 20 locations in China, including Hubei province in central China, the so-called Singing Sand Dunes in the Mingsha Shan Desert in Xinjiang Province in the northwest, Zhangye Danxia National Geological Park in north central China, Flame Mountain in the north, Mazar Village and Dunhuang and Jiuquan in Gansu province in the northwest, as well as studios in Zhejiang province in eastern China. These expansive locations played home to pastel-coloured villages and epic battles as our heroine moves through her epic tale. &nbsp;And now you can watch this cinematic spectacle from your own home. You can watch the live-action Mulan over and over again when you unlock Premier Access on Disney+ for an additional fee of 19.99. Subscription required. </p>', '2024-03-11 17:19:15', '2024-03-21 16:33:10', 'Promotion: Watch the New Live Action Mulan at Home', 'https://images.bauerhosting.com/legacy/media/5f64/be91/359d/d8d7/f5f3/a521/EMPIRE-Mulan-BC-Headers-v2.png?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80', 'movies', 'https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/promotion-watch-the-new-live-action-mulan-at-home-sponsored/', 'Mulan has been one of the most anticipated live action remakes of the Disney...', 'news');
